1,1,ISBN 978-99936-55-01-5 3 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I HIS MAJESTY THE KING JIGME KHESAR NAMGYEL WANGCHUCK 4 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 5 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Our Nation has seen great socio-economic growth but it is more important that we have growth with equity.
2,2,"We must raise, with all our effort, the less fortunate so that they may, at the earliest, begin to partake in the opportunities brought by modernization and progress."
3,3,The government has provided education to our youth.
4,4,"But for the nation to prosper for all time, a sound education must be succeeded by access to the right jobs and responsibilities, so that our youth may bloom as individuals and at the same time serve their Nation well."
5,5,The recent Rupee shortage is a serious problem.
6,6,"I feel it is a reminder that, as a Nation, we must exercise our traditional sense of caution and work even harder as we address the challenges of the time."
7,7,"For no matter what challenges lie ahead, it is only the Bhutanese citizen who can protect and safeguard Bhutan."
8,8,"- His Majesty The Kings address to the nation during the 105th National Day celebrations, 17th December 2012, in Thimphu."
9,9,It is guided by His Majesty the Kings Vision for Bhutan and the national priorities that have been consistently underscored in Royal Addresses to the nation.
10,10,The Plan sets out an ambitious development agenda to achieve this objective and fulfill the current Governments pledge of ensuring Prosperity for All through effective empowerment of the people Wangtse Chhirpel.
11,11,"Chapter One presents the development planning framework, efforts towards operationalizing Gross National Happiness (GNH) and key milestones to be achieved by 2020 - Bhutans development planning framework continues to be guided by our development philosophy of GNH which encompasses the four pillars of sustainable and equitable socio-economic development, preservation and promotion of culture, conservation and sustainable utilization and management of the environment, and promotion of good governance."
12,12,"The GNH Index is based on biennial surveys and provides an overview of performance across 9 domains of GNH that include health, education, living standards, ecological diversity and resilience, good governance, psychological wellbeing, time use, community vitality and cultural diversity and resilience."
13,13,"Based on the 2010 GNH Index composite score of 0.743, 41 percent of Bhutanese were identified as happy being sufficient in 73 percent of the domains while the remaining 59 percent enjoyed sufficiency in 57 percent of the domains."
14,14,The GNH Policy Screening has been used as a tool to assess the impact of new policies on GNH and to mainstream GNH into all new policies being formulated against twenty-two variables representing the 9 domains of GNH.
15,15,"Since its introduction, twelve policies related to human resources, youth, education, health and nutrition, land, natural resources, and industries have been approved."
16,16,A notable paradigm shift of the Eleventh Plan is the adoption of a Results Based Planning (RBP) framework that articulates clear outcomes and outputs that need to be achieved in order to realize the Eleventh Plan objective of Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development.
17,17,"The outcomes are defined as Key 4 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Results Areas (KRAs) at the national, sectoral, and Dzongkhag level and categorized under each of the four pillars of GNH."
18,18,"At the national level, 16 National Key Result Areas (NKRAs) have been identified."
19,19,"At the sector and Dzongkhag levels, more than 300 Sector Key Result Areas (SKRAs) and Dzongkhag Key Result Areas (DKRAs) that are aligned to meet the 16 NKRAs have been identified."
20,20,"Furthermore, the performance of all government agencies towards the delivery of the NKRAs, SKRAs and DKRAs are measured through corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)."
21,21,The KRAs are a result of extensive consultations with stakeholders right down to the grassroots level.
22,22,"In defining them, key aspects of the Vision 2020, Economic Development Policy 2010 (EDP 2010), the GNH 2010 Index, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) the SAARC Development Goals (SDGs), the Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA), and the Strategy for GNH (SGNH) have also been taken into consideration."
23,23,"A particular significance of the Eleventh Plan is that it serves as a vital platform for achieving three key and related national milestones by the year 2020, which are namely the objectives articulated in Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity, and Happiness (Vision 2020), the objectives of self-reliance and full employment of the EDP 2010 and graduating from the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCs)."
24,24,"While our socio-economic indicators show that we are making good progress towards achieving these milestones by 2020, with less than 7 years remaining, there are important challenges that need to be urgently addressed."
25,25,"Key challenges related to Vision 2020 include strengthening the various processes, interactions and systems of a well-functioning democracy; ensuring quality of social outcomes due to widening disparities and inequalities in health, education, income and unemployment; addressing new social challenges arising from rapid development and urbanization; diversification of the economy to reduce economic vulnerability and absorb a growing and increasingly educated labour force; balancing our high environmental aspirations and pressing developmental needs; and strengthening the capacity of key national and local government institutions."
26,26,"With regard to the EDP 2010, much remains to be done in terms of the progress of activities to facilitate private sector development and economic growth."
27,27,"A major challenge is to ensure that the objectives of EDP 2010 are supported by clear-cut strategies, policies, and support systems that harness our competitive advantage and address vital constraints."
28,28,"In this regard, the effective engagement of the private sector as a collaborative partner in the design of a clear roadmap for the 5 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I implementation of the EDP 2010 during the Eleventh Plan period is imperative and will be accorded high priority."
29,29,"While it is projected that Bhutan will be graduating from the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), based on the income criteria, it remains below the graduation threshold on the Human Assets Index (HAI) and Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI)."
30,30,"The challenges confronting HAI include high malnutrition among children, a high under five mortality rates of 69 per 1,000 live births (AHB 2012) and a low adult literacy rate of 55.3 percent (BLSS 2012)."
31,31,"EVI challenges include a small population size, being geographically remote and landlocked, instability of exports of goods and services, high vulnerability to natural disasters and instability of agricultural production."
32,32,Improving HAI and EVI will be vital to reach the graduation threshold.
33,33,Chapter Two reviews the demographic trends and the state of socio-economic development progress thus far.
34,34,"The first decennial Population and Housing Census of Bhutan (PHCB 2005) reports actual resident population of 634,982 comprising of 52.5 percent were males and 47.5 percent females."
35,35,"Of particular significance is the age structure, with 56 percent of the total population below the age of 24 years."
36,36,The rural and urban composition was 69.1 per cent and 30.9 percent respectively and the population density was 16 persons per square kilometer.
37,37,"According to PHCB 2005, approximately 21,894 persons or 3.4 percent of the total population were differently-abled, with speech, hearing, visual and mobility being the most common forms of impairment."
38,38,"Against this background, key demographic considerations for the Eleventh Plan include the adoption of a National Population Policy to ensure proper demographic planning, harnessing the potential demographic bonus presented by the current demographic structure to create a vibrant and sustainable economy and addressing the challenges of a gradually ageing population, growing differently-abled persons and migratory trends."
39,39,"In moving forward, it would be pertinent to take stock of key developments, including the progress made and challenges to be addressed, by categorizing them according to the four pillars of GNH."
40,40,6 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Sustainable and Equitable Socio-economic Development: A review of the poverty situation provides an overview of the progress made under this first pillar of GNH.
41,41,"According to the Poverty Analysis Report 2012, the income poverty incidence has declined from 31.7 percent in 2003 to 12 percent in 2012, exceeding the Tenth Plan target of reducing poverty to 15 percent."
42,42,Inequalities in income have also been reduced with the Gini-coefficient declining from 0.416 in 2003 to 0.36 over the same period.
43,43,"These gains are largely attributed to the effective implementation of targeted poverty reduction programmes such as the Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) and the National Rehabilitation Programme (NRP), in addition to the broad based national socio-economic development programmes."
44,44,"Despite the progress made in the reduction of overall poverty and income inequalities, significant challenges remain."
45,45,"Notably, poverty remains predominantly a rural phenomenon and considerable regional disparities exist with more than half of the 20 Dzongkhags having poverty rates above the national average of 12 percent, with Lhuentse having the highest poverty rate at 31.9 percent."
46,46,"However, some of the areas of concern such as malnutrition, female enrollment in tertiary education, maternal and under five mortality rates, spread of HIV/AIDS and the challenges of youth unemployment will need to be addressed in the Eleventh Plan."
47,47,"Preservation and Promotion of Culture: Besides the conservation of several Dzongs and monasteries, a number of new initiatives have been taken in the areas of archeology, conservation, infrastructure development, archiving and integrating technology to promote Dzongkha."
48,48,"As provided in Article 4 of the Constitution, which recognizes culture as an evolving dynamic force, emphasis is being placed to strengthen and facilitate the continued evolution of traditional values and institutions that are sustainable as a progressive society."
49,49,"In this regard, the promotion of cultural industries has been given high priority and notable achievements have been made in the promotion of local arts and crafts, nurturing the film and music industry and diversifying cultural tourism."
50,50,"In view of the multiple benefits it generates in terms of the promotion of culture, poverty reduction, 7 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I enhancing rural income and employment generation, this area will continue to receive high priority in the Eleventh Plan."
51,51,"Conservation and Sustainable Utilization and Management Environment: As a result of the traditionally high priority accorded to environmental conservation, Bhutan has been able to maintain forest coverage of 70.5 percent, exceeding the Constitutional mandate of maintaining 60 percent forest coverage at all times."
52,52,"With 51.32 percent of the country under a protected area network, Bhutan is host to one of the highest percentage of protected areas in the world."
53,53,We have successfully fulfilled international obligations under the Montreal Protocol and have pledged to perpetually remain a net carbon sink and carbon neutral country.
54,54,"While our achievements in environmental conservation have been laudable, our country has been a victim of natural disasters some of which are attributed to climate change."
55,55,"In the last five years, earthquake, cyclone, windstorm, floods, landslides and fires have been a frequent occurrence."
56,56,Ensuring a balance between our environmental aspirations and development needs are also increasingly challenging due to persistent human-wildlife conflict and the growing demand for natural resources.
57,57,Conservation of the natural environment to maintain a sustainable balance between economic development and environment conservation and improving disaster resilience and management will therefore be given utmost importance in the Eleventh Plan.
58,58,Promotion of Good Governance: Significant achievements have been made in the promotion of good governance.
59,59,Our democratic process has been further strengthened with the successful conduct of local government elections and second Parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2013 respectively.
60,60,Key constitutional bodies have been established and laws and regulations have been put in place to assist them in fulfilling their mandates.
61,61,"Further, several initiatives have been taken to strengthen public service management through civil service reforms and by enhancing efficiency in the delivery of public services."
62,62,"Transparency, financial accountability and control of corruption have been enhanced, through regular audits (600 audits in 2012) by an independently functioning Royal Audit authority; proactive measures by the independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), which include the enactment of Anti-Corruption Act 2011 and the adoption of Gift Rules 2009 and the Asset Declaration Rule 2012; and fostering the growth of a free and responsible media, that includes 12 newspapers, six radio stations and two television news channels."
63,63,"In the area of child protection, major laws such as the Child Care and Protection Act 2011 and the Child Adoption Act of Bhutan 2012 have been enacted."
64,64,"Other legislations namely the Labour and Employment Act 2007, Marriage Act 1980, Inheritance Act 1980, Citizenship Act 1985 and Royal Bhutan Police Act 2009 also address relevant child issues."
65,65,Bhutan has also conducted a mapping and assessment of the Child Protection System in Bhutan and the developed a National Plan of Action for Child Protection in Bhutan.
66,66,"The assessment clearly indicated current child protection issues, challenges faced and recommendations which will be addressed in the Eleventh Plan in order to ensure systematic and effective prevention and response to child protection issues."
67,67,"Notwithstanding the achievements made, our efforts in promoting good governance needs to be consistent and relentlessly pursued as this pillar serves as the fundamental basis for the other three pillars of GNH and is vital for establishing a vibrant democracy."
68,68,"In particular, strengthening and supporting institutions combating corruption must be accorded high priority as there is no room for complacency when it comes to addressing this challenge."
69,69,Chapter Three discusses the Macroeconomic situation and the outlook for the Eleventh Plan.
70,70,"Bhutans economy remained largely unscathed by the global economic downturn in 2009, primarily due to its limited integration with the global economy."
71,71,"Although Bhutan weathered the global economic crisis, since 2011 the economy has been experiencing unprecedented macroeconomic policy challenges arising from a combination of related factors that include a surge in capital inflows for hydropower development, rapid credit expansion, successive build-up of current account deficits with India and consequently an acute and persistent shortfall in Rupee reserves that has yet to be effectively addressed."
72,72,"Remedial policy measures 9 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I to address the lingering Rupee shortfall has resulted in a severe credit crunch in the banking sector, which continues to adversely affect private investment and growth."
73,73,Managing the rupee shortage is therefore of high priority to ensure a sound macroeconomic policy framework for effective implementation of the Eleventh Plan.
74,74,"Real Sector - The economy rendered a strong performance with real growth rate averaging 8 percent per annum over the five years of the Tenth Plan, which was fueled primarily by huge Government investments, particularly in the hydropower sector."
75,75,The lack of economic diversification has however resulted in a situation whereby large number of job seekers continues to be employed in the agriculture sector and those not willing to work in agriculture remain unemployed and poses significant macroeconomic challenges.
76,76,This has prompted the government to initiate efforts towards economic diversification that will be intensified during the Plan period.
77,77,"Establishing the necessary infrastructure, creating an enabling environment and targeted initiatives such as Rapid Investments in Selective Enterprises (RISE) will form the cornerstone of the governments diversification strategy."
78,78,"Despite a relatively high savings rate of 33.7 percent, Bhutans Gross Domestic Savings (GDS) has been inadequate to finance the significantly higher investment rate of 52.3 percent during the Tenth Plan."
79,79,Smoothening the growth in GDS to ensure greater predictability and effective intermediation through the financial sector to promote private investments is therefore a major issue of concern.
80,80,"Similar to savings, the high investment rate also needs to be assessed in light of the declining returns to capital and the high volatility in investments."
81,81,"Robust growth performance of the economy, increase in disposable incomes, and the rapid expansion of credit have contributed to a surge in imports and successive current account deficits."
82,82,"Given limited domestic capacity, there are concerns that the Bhutanese economy is overheating, putting upward pressures on prices, wages and the real exchange rate."
83,83,Inflation measured by CPI averaged about 7.7 percent per annum during the Tenth Plan.
84,84,The year-on-year inflation rate peaked to 13.53 percent in the 2nd quarter of 2012 and has and since then been on the decline.
85,85,"10 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I External Sector - The Tenth Plan period witnessed high volatility and a widening of current account deficits ranging from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 27.6 percent in 2010/11, which culminated in an acute shortage of Indian Rupee (INR) reserves."
86,86,"While exports increased by 30.5 percent in the last five years (2008/09 - 2012/13), imports grew by 132 percent during the same period mainly due to surge in hydropower related imports and the rapid expansion of credit for consumption related imports."
87,87,"A research study by UNDESA on the underlying causes of the INR shortfall points to a combination of factors, that include the surge in unsterilized hydro-related inflows which has sparked a credit multiplier effect with a strong import bias and thereby created a mismatch in INR inflows and outflows."
88,88,"The overall balance of payments position during the Tenth Plan has been positive, with successive Capital Account surpluses, averaging Nu."
89,89,"15.6 billion annually, financing the Current Account deficits."
90,90,"However, close to 74 percent of the Net Capital inflows came in the form of external borrowings."
91,91,The long term outlook of the external sector appears bright with the significant increase in export revenues expected with the commissioning of the hydro projects.
92,92,"However, caution needs to be taken and appropriate measures identified in the medium term to monitor external financing risks, given the alarming increase in short term debt instruments that come at a considerably high interest rate of 10 percent."
93,93,"A key issues arising from the external imbalances is that of defending the Ngultrum-INR peg, which has become extremely challenging given the magnitude of the imbalances in recent years and the high costs of short-term borrowings to address them."
94,94,This lingering problem that has spilled over into the Eleventh Plan has prompted the need for monetary policy objectives to be better aligned with the longer term development objectives of the country.
95,95,"The rapid expansion of domestic credit has largely translated into imports, thereby exerting pressure on 11 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I the peg and draining of INR reserves."
96,96,"Another challenge of the monetary sector is that the banking sector has been characterized by high volatility in its liquidity, with a volatility coefficient of 0.76 during the Tenth Plan."
97,97,"1.1 billion in 2011, liquidity spiked to Nu."
98,98,An important aspect of monetary policy in Bhutan involves the management of foreign reserves.
99,99,Convertible currency constitutes close to 90 percent of our foreign reserves despite the fact the major share of our current account transactions are denominated in INR.
100,100,The lingering INR shortfall and its effects provides a compelling argument for a more dynamic reserve management system that appropriately balances the composition of our reserves between INR and other convertible currencies and ensures the sustainability of the pegged exchange rate regime.
101,101,Fiscal Sector - The governments fiscal performance has also come under scrutiny as excessive spending by the government has been cited as a key cause of the Rupee crunch.
102,102,"With government expenditure averaging 39 percent of nominal GDP and the size of recent hydro power investments being nearly equivalent to GDP, such concerns are not without merit."
103,103,"However, the governments expenditure on the current account is offset to a large extent by corresponding inflows of aid and revenue from hydropower sales."
104,104,"Moreover, austerity measures that effect critical investments in public infrastructure and services would undermine broader national goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development."
105,105,"Nevertheless, various reforms to broaden the tax base and rein in unproductive and recurrent expenditure would help in addressing current macroeconomic imbalances."
106,106,The ceiling for fiscal deficit during the Eleventh Plan has been set significantly lower at 3 percent of GDP to ensure that the government limits deficit financing in view of the current liquidity crunch in the domestic market.
107,107,The macroeconomic challenges that transpired during the Tenth Plan period have also highlighted the need for effective coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities.
108,108,"For a small open economy like Bhutan, such coordination is critical to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment through periodic joint assessments of the real, fiscal and monetary sectors; formulation of mutually reinforcing preventive measures; and ensuring effective remedial measures during times of crisis."
109,109,The lingering INR crunch has brought the importance and need for such coordination to the fore.
110,110,"12 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Macro-economic outlook for the Eleventh Plan - Real GDP is projected to increase by an average of close to 12 percent per annum, with the hydropower sector driving most of the growth."
111,111,"While the projections show a very optimistic growth scenario, the macroeconomic challenges of recent years underscores the need to prudently address various issues in the real, external and monetary sectors."
112,112,"Given the huge revenue gains expected from the hydropower sector, there is also a growing imperative for preventive measures against the phenomenon of Dutch disease."
113,113,"In this regard, the prudent management and use of hydropower inflows towards an effective strategy for economic diversification, productivity enhancement through knowledge and skills development and employment creation will be critical."
114,114,"The external sector is expected to worsen with current account deficits averaging 28 percent of GDP per annum over the Plan period and as high as 34.7 percent of GDP in 2015/16, largely on account of imports for hydropower projects."
115,115,"External borrowing will continue to be the dominant source of financing the Current Account deficit, accounting for approximately 60 percent of all inflows."
116,116,The Eleventh Plan expenditure outlay is estimated to be around Nu.
117,117,213 billion of which 71 percent is allocated to the central agencies and 29 percent to the local governments.
118,118,"Of this, current expenditure is Nu.121 billion while capital expenditure is Nu.92 billion, which is an increase of 63 percent and 24 percent over that of the Tenth respectively."
119,119,Resources are projected at Nu.
120,120,"198 billion, comprising of domestic revenues of Nu.140 billion and external grants of Nu.58 billion."
121,121,"As such, the projected fiscal deficit is Nu."
122,122,"15 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, which will mainly be covered through concessional borrowings."
123,123,"Domestic resources are projected to increase by 55 percent due to the commissioning of three hydro-power projects while grants are projected to increase by 13 percent over that of the Tenth Plan, mainly on account of increase in Government of Indias assistance from Nu."
124,124,34 billion to Nu.45 billion.
125,125,The overall level of assistance from other development partners is projected to decline as a result of phasing out of assistance by some partners.
126,126,"The total public debt stock, 99 percent of which is external borrowings, is expected to increase by 135 percent in the Eleventh Plan, from Nu."
127,127,"Of the total debt, 80 percent is denominated in INR on account of borrowings for hydropower projects, which are expected to increase by 184 percent from Nu."
128,128,"While debt has been increasing substantially and is expected to be 121 percent of GDP, Bhutans debt stock is classified as sustainable since 80 percent of the debt are for self-liquidating hydro-power projects."
129,129,13 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Chapter Four introduces our socio-economic needs and aspirations for the next five years.
130,130,"It discusses the Eleventh Plan objectives, national key result areas and key performance indicators, strategic thrust areas and the mechanism for monitoring and evaluation."
131,131,The underlying objective of the Eleventh Plan is to achieve Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development.
132,132,Inclusive Social Development requires reducing poverty and inequality by enhancing the standard of living and the quality of life of the most vulnerable sections of our society.
133,133,Green Development means ensuring carbon neutral development at all times.
134,134,"To realize the Eleventh Plan objective of Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio- Economic Development, 16 National Key Result Areas (NKRAs), key national outcomes and outputs, needs to be achieved over the next five years."
135,135,"The 16 NKRAs, which are categorized under each of the four pillars of GNH, are defined as follows: Under the pillar of Sustainable and Equitable Socio-economic Development there are four NKRAs namely Sustained Economic Growth; Poverty Reduced and MDG Plus achieved; Food Secure and Sustained; and Full Employment."
136,136,"The achievement of these four NKRAs will be measured by corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as the annual GDP growth rates, inflation, poverty, enrollment, mortality, employment, cereal sufficiency target etc."
137,137,"Under the pillar of Preservation and Promotion of Culture there are two NKRAs defined as Strengthened Bhutanese Identity, Social Cohesion and Harmony; and Indigenous Wisdom, Arts and Crafts Promoted for Sustainable Livelihood."
138,138,"The corresponding KPIs to measure progress include GNH Index, rural households engaged in cultural industries and jobs created."
139,139,Under the pillar of Conservation and Sustainable Utilization and Management of the Environment there are four NKRAs namely Carbon Neutral/Green and Climate Resilient Development; Sustainable Utilization and Management of Natural Resources; Water Security; and Improved Disaster Resilience and Management Mainstreamed.
140,140,The NKRAs have corresponding KPIs to measure performance.
141,141,Water is given special focus in the Eleventh Plan in view of its 14 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I importance for the basic survival of all living beings and for our hydroelectric projects and agriculture.
142,142,It has also been one of the major difficulties faced by the Dzongkhags and communities and therefore an ambitious target of ensuring 24 hours water supply has been set.
143,143,Under the pillar Promotion of Good Governance there are six NKRAs covering Improved Public Service Delivery; Democracy and Governance Strengthened; Gender Friendly Environment for Womens Participation; Corruption Reduced; Safe Society; and Needs of Vulnerable Group Addressed.
144,144,"The KPIs such as reducing turnaround time for Government to Citizen, Government to Business and Government to Government services; monitoring government performance; drafting legislation to ensure quota for women in elected offices; reducing female unemployment; implementation of national anti-corruption strategy; and reducing crime per 1,000 population will be the basis for tracking progress towards these NKRAs."
145,145,"The main strategic thrust to achieve the national outcomes and outputs will be on i) inclusive social development, ii) accelerated green economic development and iii) strategic infrastructure development."
146,146,"Inclusive social development which will focus on further reducing income and multidimensional poverty, address emerging social issues and improve social outcomes in health and education sectors."
147,147,"The targeted key interventions include the Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) to address extreme rural poverty at village and community levels; the National Rehabilitation Programme (NRP) to enhance the productive asset base of marginalized households; the Local Government Empowerment Programme (LGEP) to enhance decision making capacity and improve service delivery through provision of essential equipment, machinery and Nu."
148,148,"2 million per year per Gewog; special programme for vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, differently-abled persons, and youth; and targeted health and education interventions to reach the unreached for Dzongkhags with poor health and education outcomes."
149,149,Green Accelerated Economic Development which will focus on economic diversification through the development of non-hydropower sectors and by fostering the growth of a dynamic private sector that catalyzes a transition to a green economy.
150,150,"Key interventions include the Economic Stimulus Programme 15 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I to address the present credit crunch and make finances available for productive sectors; Rapid Investment in Selected Enterprises (RISE) Programme, the flagship programme to accelerate economic growth and achieve the objective of self reliance, will target an end-to-end development of non-hydro sectors such as tourism, agro-processing, construction, small and cottage industries including cultural industries and manufacturing and mining; optimizing opportunities of accelerated hydropower development to enhance local trade and commerce, participation of local private sector and workforce and aligning corporate social responsibilities of hydropower projects with local needs and plans; enabling environment through simplification of the policy and regulatory framework and facilitating vital infrastructure development such as surface and air transport, dry ports and industrial estates."
151,151,Strategic Infrastructure Development which will focus on development of critical infrastructure to complement the efforts under the above two thrust areas and to achieve the Eleventh Plan objectives.
152,152,"The investments will primarily be in urban, transport, ICT, energy, economic, social and cultural infrastructure."
153,153,"These include the development of 2 regional hubs and infrastructure facilities and services in Dzongkhag headquarters and towns; expansion and improvement of road and air connectivity; expansion of ICT infrastructure including a national data centre, government intranet system, national broadband master-plan and facilities for G2C, G2G and G2B services; expansion of energy infrastructure through the accelerated development of 10,000 MW of hydropower, construction of transmission lines and substations and expansion of rural electrification; the development of dry ports in Phuentsholing and Jigmeling or Nanglam and industrial parks in Mongar, Samtse, Samdrup Jongkhar and Sarpang; and construction of educational and health infrastructure and renovation/construction of Dzongs."
154,154,The chapter concludes with discussion on the proposed monitoring and elevation system of the Eleventh Plan.
155,155,The monitoring and evaluation will be based on the National Monitoring and Evaluation System (NMES) which comprises the monitoring and evaluation institutional set-up and procedures and the Planning & Monitoring system (PlaMS).
156,156,The Eleventh Plan will give particular emphasis to institutionalizing the evaluation of programmes and projects which are currently limited to those that are donor funded.
157,157,"Further, the Mid-Term Review of the Eleventh Plan will assess progress in the implementation of the Plan and make necessary adjustments in policies, programmes and projects and allocation of 16 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I resources."
158,158,Two Round Table Meetings (RTM) will be held; one during the inception of the Eleventh Plan to sensitize development partners on the priorities and policies and the other towards the middle of the Plan to share progress in implementation of the Plan.
159,159,"Bilateral consultations, programme and project specific reviews, and monitoring and evaluation meetings will be held between the Royal Government and development partners."
160,160,Chapter Five presents the Central Plans and the Sector Key Result Areas (SKRAs) with corresponding KPIs.
161,161,"Education Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector include last mile access to education, disparities in education outcomes at the local levels and catering to the special needs of children with disabilities."
162,162,A major issue of concern is the relevance and quality of education.
163,163,"Although improvements in efficiency indicators indicate that the quality of education has improved over the years, a number of reports reveal that an increasing numbers of students, including graduates from vocational and tertiary institutions, are inadequately prepared to enter the workforce, which has resulted in a paradoxical situation of relatively high levels of youth unemployment and a critical skills shortage at the same time."
164,164,"Evidently, changing realities, both domestic and external, are placing a demand on our education system to achieve higher standards at a scale that has never been met or required before."
165,165,"According to Royal Education Councils (REC) research study on the quality of education in Bhutan, the overall trend indicates that there is a big gap between the current and the desired state in the quality of outcomes and processes, with under- prepared teachers, lack of appropriate curricular resources, and poor instructional leadership and in-service training as the three critical reasons for the persistence of ineffective classroom practices across schools and arguably also across vocational and tertiary education institutions."
166,166,"A major challenge, which is also related to the above, is the sustainability of financing the expenditure of the education sector."
167,167,The main objectives of the education sector in the Eleventh Plan are to ensure quality of education service delivery; ensure education sustainability; and achieve MDG plus.
168,168,"Strategies include targeted intervention programmes, rationalization of schools through a consolidation programme; enhancing professional development for teachers; improved service delivery and promoting private participation."
169,169,"Health Sector: The key issues and challenge of this sector include delivering quality 17 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I health care; acute shortage of all categories of health personnel against the growing need to expand health services; growing incidence of non-communicable diseases; spread of HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria and outbreaks of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs); maternal and child health; nutrition; and sustainable healthcare financing."
170,170,"The main objectives of this sector in the Eleventh Plan are to improve access to quality and equitable health services, strengthen preventive, promotive, rehabilitative and palliative health services and promote efficiency and effectiveness in financing and delivery of health services."
171,171,Strategies to achieve these objectives include greater emphasis on preventive and promotional measures; human resources development; sustainable health financing; standardization of eHealth and interoperability; and consolidation of health infrastructure.
172,172,Human Resource Development & Management: The key issues and challenges of this sector are the high percentage of civil servants not meeting the minimum qualification criteria; mismatch between skills and jobs available; retention of civil servants; and unsustainable growth in the size of civil service.
173,173,"To address these challenges, strategies will focus on creating a pool of skilled manpower aligned to meet the objectives of EDP 2010, with an emphasis on addressing the acute shortage of skilled professionals such as doctors, educationists, engineers, architects and ICT specialists; strengthening human resource management systems and processes to enhance performance, efficiency and motivation of the civil servants; review and ensure full implementation of National Human Resource Development Policy 2010 to address issues of coordination and synergies."
174,174,"Employment: Although the unemployment rate has declined from to 4.2 percent in 2008 to 2.1 percent in 2012, major challenges with regard to the quality of employment remain."
175,175,"There is also a lack of synergy between the education system and manpower needs given the shortage of skilled manpower across sectors, and a mismatch of employee aspirations and jobs available given significant import of labor, particularly in the construction sector."
176,176,"In the Eleventh Plan, 82,000 new jobs need to be created for approximately 120,000 job seekers, to achieve the target of full employment defined as unemployment of 2.5 percent."
177,177,The main objective of this sector is to achieve full and productive employment.
178,178,Strategies to achieve this objective include implementation of the Rapid Investments in Selected Enterprises (RISE) programme and strengthening linkages between the education system and manpower needs of the country to address the mismatch of skills and aspirations.
179,179,"18 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Renewable Natural Resources (RNR) Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector are loss of agriculture land, declining productivity, human wildlife conflict, shortage of farm labourers and irrigation facilities, pest and disease management and weak post harvest management and facilities."
180,180,The key objectives of this sector in the Eleventh Plan are to enhance food and nutrition security; improve rural livelihood; accelerate and sustain RNR sector growth; and promote sustainable management and utilization of natural resources.
181,181,The strategies to achieve these objectives include targeted and commodity focused interventions; foster transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture; ensure an enabling environment; and promote private sector participation and contract farming.
182,182,"Tourism Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector include accessibility, seasonality, the lack of regional spread and product diversification, shortage of skilled manpower in the form of trained guides, skilled workers in hospitality sector, qualified and experienced professionals in product development, destination marketing and other tourism-related services."

185,185,"The key strategy will be to promote Bhutan as an exclusive destination based on high level of services, diversified tourism products and improved tourism infrastructure facilities."
186,186,"The focus will be on regional spread, addressing seasonality issues and community participation."
187,187,"Trade, Industries & Mines Sector: The key issue in terms of trade is the lack of product diversification of our exports, with about 80 percent of total exports consisting of electricity, mineral products and base metal, which are all highly vulnerable."
188,188,Diversification of our exports into agricultural and non-mineral and non-metal products requires substantial investments.
189,189,"In terms of industries, about 85 percent of Bhutanese industries are small and micro industries, which are constrained by lack of access to capital, technology, markets and labour resulting in low volume, high cost and inferior quality products."
190,190,The mining sector suffers from the absence of a clear mineral development policy and human resource constraints.
191,191,The main objectives of this sector in the Eleventh Plan are to create an enabling environment for private sector development and stimulating export growth; ensure green and sustainable development of SMEs; ensure sustainable geo-scientific investigation and mineral development; and prevent and reduce risks associated with geo-hazards.
192,192,"Strategies to achieve these objectives include a coordinated implementation of 19 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I the Economic Development Policy 2010, the implementation of Rapid Investment in Selected Sector (RISE) Programme and creation of an enabling environment through infrastructure investments, and addressing issues such as excise refunds, access to finance particularly for cottage, small and medium industries, reduction in turn-around-time for Government to Business (G2B) services specially in terms of government clearances/ approvals, and development of capital markets."
193,193,"Energy sector: This sector is the lynchpin of our economy, accounting for about 18 percent of total revenues and about 20 percent of GDP."
194,194,"The key issues and challenges of this sector include high upfront investment costs for hydro-power projects, which pose significant challenges in terms of raising financing for the project; maintaining the balance between the needs of domestic consumption and export earnings and the demand by households and industries; the viability of the cost of electricity generation and supply and current tariff levels; infrastructure development; system reinforcement; building human resource capacity; and GLoF and hydrological risks."

196,196,"The key strategies to achieve these objectives are strengthening of institutional and human capacity of the sector, rural electrification, investment in transmission lines and formulation of energy allocation policy to ensure sustainable and optimum utilization of additional firm power and to enhance energy security and reduce dependency on fossil fuel by promoting other forms of alternate renewable energy."
197,197,"Information Communication & Technology and Media Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector include the significantly higher telecommunication tariffs than those in the region which negates the other comparative advantages; lack of international redundancy and a shortage of qualified ICT professionals, all of which pose a challenge for Bhutan to serve as a potential hub for ICT and ICT enabled services."
198,198,"The main objectives of this sector are to promote Bhutanese information society, strengthen good governance, enhance economic development and develop a responsible, vibrant and creative information and media industry."
199,199,"The main strategies to achieve these objectives are the implementation of the e-Gov Master Plan, capacity building and expansion of ICT infrastructure."
200,200,Opportunities to tap mobile technology to provide public services will be actively explored.
201,201,"The main objective of this sector in the Eleventh Plan will be to increase access to safe, reliable, affordable, eco-friendly and convenient transport services."
202,202,"Strategies to achieve this objective include strengthening the capacity of Paro International Airport, improving the three domestic airports, expansion of air services to and from international destinations, increasing access to public transportation in rural areas and eco-friendly mass public transportation services in urban areas, and improving driver licensing procedures, motor vehicle fitness standards, public safety awareness campaigns and equipping road safety authorities with necessary equipments and tools to monitor road safety."
203,203,Roads & Bridges Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector are road safety with some highways constructed in the early 1960s and 70s when vehicular traffic was significantly lower and on account of difficult geographical terrain; quality of construction and high transport costs; and financial sustainability of maintaining the vast network of road constructed and blacktopping of unpaved roads.
204,204,The two main objectives of this sector are to increase efficiency and reliability of road infrastructure to facilitate economic development and strengthen national security and ensure sustainability through mechanization and greater private sector participation.
205,205,"Strategies include institutional and human resource development to strengthen the capacity of road sector to plan, design, build and maintain road network; expansion of the national highway backbone grid, improvement of road specifications and standards; geometric improvements and regular maintenance; exploring tunneling of certain stretches of the highways; and involvement of the private sector in the maintenance of roads to ensure financial sustainability."
206,206,"Construction: The key issues and challenges of this sector are low demand for construction sector jobs due to low wages, lack of job security, and low levels of mechanization and limited design, planning and supervision capability due to shortage of qualified professionals and a lack of basic tools and technology which result in relatively high costs of construction, poor quality of work, and high maintenance costs."
207,207,"The main objective of this sector in the Eleventh Plan is to enhance the quality of construction industry through the introduction of new energy efficient technology, mechanization and human resource development."
208,208,"Strategies to achieve this objective include training and capacity building of professionals 21 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I in the construction sector, consolidation of contract packages, promotion of construction mechanization and use of local construction materials, special service conditions to make construction jobs attractive, and aligning vocational training programmes to the needs of construction industry."
209,209,"Human Settlement and Housing Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector are a lack of clear legislation and polices in human settlement planning, gaps in inter- sectoral coordination; limited human resource capacity, both in terms of numbers and skills; and housing shortages given that the National Housing Development Corporations housing stock is 1,122 units."
210,210,"The shortages are particularly severe in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, Gasa, Lhuentse and Samdrup Jongkhar, where for example, many Bhutanese in Phuentsholing are compelled to live across the border while in Gasa and Lhuentse civil servants are living in temporary makeshift huts."
211,211,"While increasing the housing stock is imperative, making it affordable, particularly for the low and middle income group, is a major challenge."
212,212,"The main objectives of this sector are to ensure balanced and sustainable development of human settlements; improve quality of urban infrastructure and services; and provide safe, aesthetic, adequate and affordable housing."
213,213,"Strategies to achieve these objectives include planned and sustainable development of human settlements through new legislations and policies and improved rules and regulations; accelerated development of valley plans, regional hub plans and rural-urban development plans in order to contain rural urban migration; capacity building of engineers, architects and planners; adoption of new technologies and design innovation to reduce the cost of construction while ensuring quality; increase low income housing for rental; and promotion of home ownership."
214,214,"Emerging Social Challenges: With rapid development, Bhutan is confronted with new social issues such as those related to youth, senior citizens, single parents, orphans, differently-abled persons, domestic violence and crime."
215,215,The lack of a central agency that is responsible for coordinating efforts poses a major challenge to effectively address these emerging issues.
216,216,Current efforts that are being undertaken are based on the initiative of various sectors and civil society organizations and associations and many of these organizations are constrained by lack of technical and financial resources.
217,217,"There is also a paucity of studies, baseline data, and surveys to clearly ascertain the situation and recommend appropriate interventions."
218,218,"The main objective to address emerging social challenges will be to ensure access to integrated critical services covering health, education, justice and protection, counselling, welfare and rehabilitation."
219,219,Strategies will include the conduct of detailed studies on emerging social issues to enable appropriate 22 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I intervention programmes and strengthened partnerships with CSOs.
220,220,"Sports: The lack of a focused and coherent strategy, despite more than three decades since the establishment of the National Sports Association and the Bhutan Olympic Committee (BOC), has been a major issue for the development of sports in Bhutan."
221,221,"The sector is also challenged by the lack of infrastructure facilities, human resources capacity and financial sustainability."
222,222,"The main objectives of this sector in the Eleventh Plan are to establish a representative and organized sport system that fosters excellence in sports and promotes recreation throughout the country; promotes a vibrant sporting culture that contributes to addressing youth issues, lifestyle related diseases, employment, community cohesiveness and international image of the country."
223,223,The main strategy will be the implementation of the Strategic Vision and Road Map for Development of Sports in Bhutan by the BOC.
224,224,"As such, the preservation and promotion of culture is accorded priority not just for strengthening our identity but is an economic imperative to address poverty through the development of cultural industries."
225,225,"A major issue and challenge to the preservation and promotion of culture is related to keeping the age old local customs and traditions alive with many of the younger generation either not keen or not having the required skills to continue these traditions, with many having left their villages, a consequence of increasing rural-urban migration trend."
226,226,"The tangible cultural properties such as Dzongs and Lhakangs are under threat of natural and manmade disasters such as earthquakes, windstorms, landslides, vandalism and fire and conserving and restoring these monuments require substantial resources."
227,227,"The promotion of cultural industries which has potential and is vital for poverty alleviation is confronted with challenges arising from access to finance, poor economy of scale, quality of products and access to markets."
228,228,"The main objectives of this sector are to strengthen national identity, social cohesion and harmony; and promote indigenous wisdom, arts and crafts for sustainable livelihood."
229,229,"Key strategies to achieve these objectives are strengthening institutional capacity for inventory and documentation of oral traditions, history, arts, living 1Article 4 of the Constitution 23 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I expressions, and architectural knowledge; preservation and promotion of arts, social practices, Tshechus, rituals and festivals; host regular cultural exhibitions and colloquiums; conservation and restoration of cultural heritage sites, including the incorporation of disaster resilient measures; capacity development for research and documentation of the performing arts and conservation and restoration measures through trainings/workshops; archival surveys and documentation; and facilitating the growth of cultural industries through access to finance, product development support, raw material banks, promotion of craft clusters, craft bazaars and business incubators."
230,230,Conservation of Environment - Conservation of environment is an integral part of our development strategy to ensure that socio-economic development efforts do not come at the cost of our natural environment.
231,231,"Since 2009, all new policies introduced are subject to a GNH Policy Screening to assess the impact of a new policy on GNH."
232,232,"The GNH Policy Screening tool comprise twenty two variables of which three are on environment, namely water and air pollution, land degradation and bio-diversity health."
233,233,"Due to the rapid pace of socio-economic development, land degradation, air pollution, and solid waste management are major issues and challenges facing this sector."
234,234,"However, ensuring water security is currently the most significant issue facing this sector and has been identified as one of the 16 National Key Result Areas to be achieved over the Eleventh Plan period."
235,235,Water is a vital natural resource for our basic survival as well as for our economy given our high dependence on agriculture and hydropower.
236,236,"Despite having one of the worlds highest per capita availability of water, water shortage is a major issue in both rural and urban communities."
237,237,"In 2011, electricity sector experienced negative growth mainly due to hydrological risk."
238,238,"The main objectives of the environment sector are to ensure carbon neutral and climate resilient development, enhance sustainable utilization and management of natural resources and enhance water security."
239,239,Key strategies to achieve these objectives include implementation of the National Strategy and Action Plan for Low Carbon Development 2012; mainstreaming of environment across all sectoral and local government programmes and projects; implementation of the Integrated Water Resource Management Plan; and addressing water security.
240,240,"Good Governance - Being vital for sustainable and equitable socio-economic development, the Eleventh Plan will continue to give emphasis to good governance by strengthening democracy, improving public service delivery, promoting gender 24 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I equality, curbing corruption, enhancing safety and addressing the needs of the vulnerable groups."
241,241,"The key issues and challenges facing this sector are lack of institutional and human capacity, particularly at the local government level; growth in quantity and complexity of the policy and regulatory environment; gender related issues such as relatively high female unemployment, and low female enrollment in tertiary education, which are a concern particularly in terms of achievement of the MDGs; and sustaining the progress made in combating corruption."
242,242,The main objectives under this pillar will be to further improve public service delivery and strengthen democracy and good governance.
243,243,"Key strategies to achieve these objectives include the implementation of the Government Performance Management System, National Anti-corruption Strategy, improving public service delivery through G2C, G2B and G2G services, and capacity building and awareness campaigns to enhance transparency, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness in governance."
244,244,"Chapter Six discusses the Local Government Plans comprising of 20 Dzongkhags and 4 Thromdes, and the Dzongkhag Key Result Areas and Thromde Key Result Areas with corresponding KPIs."
245,245,"Since the inception of Fifth Plan in 1981, the Royal Government has actively pursued a proactive decentralization policy to promote participatory development, which culminated in the introduction of a Gewog-based planning approach in the Ninth Plan, whereby Local Governments (LG) formulated their Five Year Plans based on priorities identified by communities at the Gewog level."
246,246,"To further strengthen the decentralization process, a formula based rationalized Annual Grants System (AGS) using population, poverty and area as the criteria and that takes into account the principles of equity, transparency and objectivity was introduced during the Tenth Plan."
247,247,A key objective of the AGS was to provide predictability of resource availability to local governments and flexibility in its use.
248,248,"In addition to the SKRAs, Dzongkhag Key Results Areas (DKRAs) with corresponding KPIs have been defined for each Dzongkhag based on the four pillars of GNH."
249,249,"The structure of the local government plans, whereby the DKRAs and strategies are anchored to the circumstances of each Dzongkhag, also emphasizes the need for a common but differentiated approach to development."
250,250,The high priority accorded to local government plans in the Eleventh Plan is evident from the formula based annual grants of Nu.
251,251,"15 billion for local government plans, which is an increase of 25 percent over Tenth Plan outlay, Nu."
252,252,5 billion for local government empowerment programme and Nu.
253,253,5 billion allocated to four Thromdes.
254,254,"In total, the local governments receive 25 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I direct capital allocation of Nu."
255,255,25 billion or about 28 percent of the total capital outlay.
256,256,"In addition, resources for local government education activities and targeted poverty intervention programmes are provided through central government budget."
257,257,"In order to enhance the usefulness and relevance of the AGS, both in terms of viability and sustainability, the formula for resource allocation to local governments has been revised for the Eleventh Plan with introduction of two additional criteria, namely Multidimensional Poverty Index2 (MPI) and Transport Cost Index3 (TCI)."
258,258,"To ensure equity, efficiency, accountability and transparency for the realization of the Eleventh Plan goal and outcomes, the responsibilities among Central agencies, Class A Thromdes, Dzongkhags and Gewogs have been clearly delineated based on the division of responsibilities framework, which is guided by the principle of subsidiarity."
259,259,"To further strengthen local governments, reforms to create incentives for local governments to enhance revenues from commercial activities in their Dzongkhags will also be undertaken as a priority."
260,260,The Dzongkhags will pursue strategies that will contribute to reduction in multidimensional poverty.
261,261,"The strategies to enhance household incomes will include increasing agriculture, livestock and non-wood forest productivity, developing tourism potential and cottage, small and medium industries."
262,262,The Dzongkhags will work in close collaboration with the central agencies to further improve health and education outcome.
263,263,"To accelerate poverty reduction at community and household levels, targeted poverty intervention programmes such as Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) and National Rehabilitation Programmes will be implemented."
264,264,The Thromdes will focus on development of sustainable and highly livable urban towns.
265,265,The preparation of structural and local area plans for core areas will be pri- oritized to prevent unplanned development.
266,266,"The issues of drinking water shortage will be addressed by exploring and investing in construction of bore wells, ground water exploration and water reservoir to ensure 24 hours of adequate and reliable supply of clean drinking water."
267,267,"Further, the Thromdes will ensure urban roads, street lights, recreational parks, sports facilities, sewerage and waste management system etc are constructed and improved to enhance safety and promote commu- nity vitality."
268,268,High priority will also be accorded to initiatives that will enhance their revenues.
269,269,"Its goals, objectives and strategies are guided by His Majesty the Kings Vision for Bhutan and the national priorities that have been consistently underscored in Royal Addresses on various occasions to the nation."
270,270,The development planning framework is based on our development philosophy of Gross National Happiness.

278,278,"GNH broadly encompasses four pillars, which are namely i) sustainable and equitable socio- 30 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I economic development, ii) preservation and promotion of culture, iii) conservation and sustainable utilization and management of the environment, and iv) promotion of good governance."
279,279,1.2.1 Result Based Planning The Plan is based on the Results Based Planning (RBP) framework.
280,280,The RBP framework articulates the outcomes and outputs that need to be achieved over the next five years in order to achieve the Eleventh Plan objective of Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development.
281,281,"The outcomes and outputs, defined as Key Result Areas, have been identified at the National, Sectoral, Dzongkhag, Thromdes and Gewog levels."
282,282,"The result areas were identified through a two year process of extensive consultation involving all relevant stakeholders, both at the central and local levels, and attempts to capture the many needs and aspirations of the nation and its people."
283,283,"Further, the Constitution of Bhutan, the national long term goals envisioned in the Vision 2020, the Economic Development Policy 2010 (EDP 2010), the GNH 2010 Index, Bhutans progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SAARC Development Goals (SDGs), Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA), international, regional and national commitments on environment, population and development, women and children and the Strategy for GNH (SGNH) etc have all been taken into consideration while defining the key result areas."
284,284,"At the national level, there are 16 National Key Result Areas (NKRAs) which needs to be achieved over the next five years to realize the Eleventh Plan objective."
285,285,"All central ministries, constitutional bodies, autonomous agencies, Dzongkhags, Thromdes and Gewogs contribute to, through their respective sectors, Dzongkhag, Thromde and Gewog Key Result Areas."

317,317,Policies are screened against twenty-two variables representing the 9 GNH domains.
318,318,"Each screening question has a 4-pointer scale ranging from 1 to 4, 1 being negative and 4 positive."
319,319,Below is an example under the psychological wellbeing domain: Table 1.2 GNH Policy Screening Tool Scoring Scale Will increase levels of stress in the population Do not know the effects on levels of stress in the population Will not have any appreciable effects on levels of stress in the population Will decrease levels of stress in the population 1 Negative 2 uncertain 3 Neutral 4 Positive The GNH screening of each policy is carried out by the proponent sector and the GNHC Secretariat involving a minimum of 10-15 individuals representing diverse professions/fields.
320,320,The threshold for a policy to be GNH favourable is 66 (22 variables*neutral score of 3).

322,322,"1.4 Key Development Milestones The Eleventh Plan will also be the basis for achieving the three key and related milestones by the year 2020: i) the goals and objectives articulated in Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity, and Happiness, ii) the objectives of self-reliance and full employment of the Economic Development Policy 2010 and iii) graduating from the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCs)."
323,323,"While our socio-economic indicators show that we are making good progress towards achieving these milestones, there are important challenges that need to be urgently addressed."
324,324,"With just seven years left for 2020, the success of the Eleventh Plan will be critical in our efforts to achieve these milestones."
325,325,"1.4.1 Bhutan 2020 - A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness Since its launch in the year 2000, Bhutan 2020 A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness formed the basis for the formulation and implementation of successive Five Year Plans."
326,326,"The Vision Statement underscores the need to ensure the future independence, sovereignty and security of our nation-state as a precondition for the fulfillment of the hopes and aspirations of our nation and people."
327,327,"Furthermore, it provides six guiding principles in the pursuit of this goal: maintenance and strengthening of our distinct Bhutanese identity; maintenance of unity and harmony; ensuring stability; promoting self-reliance; ensuring that development is sustainable; and demonstrating flexibility and capacity to adapt to change."
328,328,"As we approach 2020, a brief review of where we are today and what remains to be done over the next seven years was assessed on the basis of the Vision Statements five thematic headings encompassing: our nation, our people, our economy, our environment and our institutions."
329,329,"37 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Our Nation Much has been achieved towards strengthening the peace, security and prosperity of our nation."
330,330,"Today, Bhutan is a Democratic Constitutional Monarchy with a democratically elected parliament and government."
331,331,"State Principles based on which the country will be governed, the powers and responsibilities of various authorities and the fundamental rights and duties of its people are clearly articulated in a written Constitution."
332,332,"The King is the symbol of unity of the Kingdom and the people of Bhutan, whose Vision and guidance on national priorities serve as beacons for the future direction of our nation."
333,333,"While much has been achieved towards strengthening our nations independence, security and sovereignty, there are many new challenges for a young democracy."
334,334,"The cornucopia of processes, interactions and systems of a well functioning democracy has to be learnt gradually through experience."
335,335,"This needs to be complemented by education and awareness, promotion of female participation in governance, capacity building of our legislators, strengthening of the media and other such efforts."
336,336,Our People The quality of life and the overall socio-economic status of our people has improved significantly.
337,337,Our primary school enrollment rates have increased from 72 percent in 19997 to near 100 percent.
338,338,The development concept of GNH has been introduced into the core of our education system.
339,339,It strives to foster wholesome development of our children so that they are better prepared to appreciate the importance of moral and ethical choices in their lives.
340,340,A full range of educational institutions for a knowledge based society have been established and more are in pipeline.
341,341,"However, the quality of social outcomes remains a challenge with disparities and inequalities at local levels."
342,342,Similarly disparities are noted in health and education outcomes.
343,343,Unemployment is low at 2.1 percent in 2012 but youth and female unemployment rates remain comparatively high.
344,344,"8Poverty Analysis 2012, NSB."
345,345,"38 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I with new social challenges related to youth issues, domestic violence, single parent households, abandoned children, a growing number of senior citizens without adequate family support, and crime."
346,346,"These issues need to be urgently looked into and addressed for our people to be self-confident, live in harmony and unity, and share a common sense of purpose and destiny."
347,347,"The economy has grown at an average of 7-8 percent per annum, unemployment rates are below 3 percent and domestic revenue is able to cover about 65 percent of our annual budgetary requirements."
348,348,"By 2020, the second transnational highway will be completed with the initiation of construction of southern east-west highway and 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity generation capacity realized."
349,349,"However, our economy continues to be aid dependent, import driven and highly vulnerable."
350,350,Economic development and structural change have not translated into commensurate increase in secondary and tertiary sector jobs.
351,351,Agriculture continues to employ about 60 percent of the population mostly in subsistence farming with significantly lower returns.
352,352,The economy lacks diversification and is predominantly driven by the hydropower sector which has limited potential for the creation of productive jobs to absorb a growing and an increasingly educated labour force.
353,353,Our vision of high-technology enterprises engaged in high value low volume products and building internationally recognized centres of excellence in health and education services remain a vision.
354,354,"In the absence of alternate growth centres, Thimphu and Phuentsholing continue to attract large number of rural-urban migrants."
355,355,"Establishment of dry ports in Phuentsholing, Samdrup Jongkhar and Gelephu to facilitate trade, supposed to have been completed by 2002 and 2007 respectively, remain unaccomplished."
356,356,"Most significantly, the macro-economic imbalances leading to the recent and lingering Rupee shortage is an indication of deficiencies in our macro-economic analytical, management and coordination capacity which need to be strengthened."
357,357,"Our Environment - Our environment remains pristine with 70.46 percent of land under forest coverage; 19,751 square kilometers under protected areas and biological corridors; and air and water quality within acceptable national standards."
358,358,39 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Our efforts towards environment conservation are further reinforced by our Constitutional mandate of maintaining a minimum of 60 percent forest coverage at all times and our commitment to the global community9 to maintain our status as a net sink for green house gasses by ensuring that such emission levels do not exceed the sequestration capacity of our forest.
359,359,"Our strong environment policies have helped maintain our natural environment, much of it pristine."
360,360,"However, population growth, urbanization, industrialization and infrastructure expansion are putting strong pressure on the environment - particularly in terms of the quality of air, water and solid waste management in urban areas and human-wildlife conflict in rural areas."
361,361,"Bhutan is also highly vulnerable to climate change related disasters such as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF), floods, landslides and drought."
362,362,"Furthermore, while Bhutan has abundant water resources many of our urban centres and town continue to face acute shortages of clean and reliable drinking water facilities, while climate change and lack of water management resources result in shortages in rural farms."
363,363,These challenges call for more innovative approaches to balancing our environmental aspirations and pressing developmental needs.
364,364,"Our Institutions Constitutional offices such as the Anti-Corruption Commission, Election Commission, Royal Audit Authority, Royal Civil Service Commission and the Supreme Court have been established."
365,365,"The formation of the Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu (DYT- Dzongkhag Development Committee) and Gewog Yargay Tshogde (GYT Block Development Committee) in 1981 and 1991, respectively; introduction of Gewog based planning framework in the Ninth Plan (2002-2008); and the allocation of rationalized formula based grants to local governments in the Tenth Plan (2008-2013); have all strengthened the decentralization and democratization process."
366,366,"However, many of these institutions being relatively new, their effective functioning are constrained by lack of proper infrastructure facilities, human resource constraints and efficient systems."
367,367,Strengthening Constitutional bodies and empowering local governments are a priority.
368,368,"In particular, to further strengthen and deepen decentralization, more needs to be done to enhance their ability to raise and retain revenues so that local governments have greater incentives to promote commercial activities."
369,369,"The strategies set out to achieve the objectives include diversification of the economic base with minimal ecological footprint, harnessing and value addition to natural resources in a sustainable manner, increasing and diversification of exports, promoting Bhutan as an organic brand, promoting industries that build Brand Bhutan10 and reducing dependency on fossil fuel especially for transportation."
370,370,"The first three years since the launch of EDP 2010 were devoted to creating an enabling environment, preparatory works for infrastructure expansion such as acquisition of land and promotion of Bhutan as a potential destination for investments through road-shows in the region."
371,371,"A credible and predictable policy environment that minimizes the cost of doing business, expedites business start ups, and facilitates Foreign Direct Investment is vital to achieve the goal and objective envisaged in the EDP."
372,372,"To create an enabling environment for the implementation of EDP 2010, new laws and policies were formulated in the last three years."
373,373,"Most significantly, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy 2002 was revised."
374,374,"The FDIs are mainly in hotel, mineral and metal based industries, agro and dairy products and ICT."
375,375,The Bhutan Education City Act 2012 was enacted to establish Bhutan as an education hub with the entry of high quality educational institutions from around the world.
376,376,"The Mineral Development Policy, Bhutan Telecommunications and Broadband Policy, Public Private Partnership Policy and Business Licensing Policy have been drafted and will be approved for implementation in the Eleventh Plan."
377,377,10Brand Bhutan Natural and pristine environment; vibrant and living culture; nation of GNH; peace and security; reliable and competitively priced energy; will form some of the countrys Unique Sell- ing Proposition (USP) based on which Brand Bhutan will be developed.
378,378,"41 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Besides, other new laws and policies proposed in EDP 2010 such as Consumer Protection Act, Competition Policy, Trade Development Act, Investment Law, and Amendment of Companies Act 2000 will be drafted and implemented in the Eleventh Plan."
379,379,"Additionally, Fiscal Incentives 2010 was implemented to stimulate private sector growth and employment generation."
380,380,"The incentives are categorized as General Incentives (applicable to all sectors), Specific Incentives (cross-sector incentives such as Cottage & Small Industries) and Sector-specific Incentives (such as ICT, Tourism, Film and Media)."
381,381,"However, the experience of using fiscal incentives to promote private sector development in Bhutan has been wrought with challenges, falling short of expectations as well as creating rent seeking behavior."
382,382,"It is widely felt that fiscal incentives during the Ninth Plan period largely resulted in industries that exploited tax differentials without any significant contribution to long term industrial development, employment and growth."
383,383,"In view of the above, regular assessment of the impact of fiscal incentives on private sector development and employment generation and concrete recommendations on how they could be better aligned to achieving the objectives of EDP 2010 is necessary."
384,384,"While an enabling environment and fiscal incentives are important, they cannot compensate for structural bottlenecks, especially the lack of infrastructure, skilled manpower and access to finance."
385,385,"Therefore, much remains to be done in terms of the physical progress of activities to facilitate private sector development and economic growth."
386,386,"The establishment of industrial parks, dry ports, and completion of alternate southern east-west highway, will therefore be expedited on a priority basis during the current Plan."
387,387,"Ultimately, the successful implementation of EDP 2010 will depend on ensuring that its objectives are supported by clear-cut strategies, policies, and support systems that harness our competitive advantages and address our constraints."
388,388,An analysis of the EDP 2010 reveals that this vital linkage is weak at best and in some cases an obvious gap exists.
389,389,"For example, four of the constraints point to a lack of trained human resources but human resource development is conspicuously absent as a strategy."
390,390,"Similarly the strategies do not address macro-economic issues related to balance of payments, fiscal deficit and foreign exchange which are highlighted as vital challenges."
391,391,"Of the 8 competitive advantages listed, the most strategic is Bhutans geographical proximity and open access to the large Indian market."
392,392,The EDP is however silent on how Bhutan can leverage its location to its B A C K G R O U N D 01 42 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I advantage.
393,393,"In this regard, it would be vital to firstly identify the medium and long term growth sectors in India and the region subsequently determine those that are most feasible for Bhutan."
394,394,"Table 1.3 EDP 2010 Competitive Advantages, Vital Constraints and Strategies Competitive Advantages Vital Constraints listed in EDP Strategies listed in EDP Political stability."
395,395,A vibrant and living culture.
396,396,Natural and pristine environment.
397,397,Geo-economic location and open access to the emerging Indian market.
398,398,Reliable and competi- tively priced energy.
399,399,Wide use of English language.
400,400,"High dependence on exter- nal aid, High fiscal deficit Weak balance of payment situation Rising public debt Unsustainable FOREX reserves due to low export base Small domestic market, Lack of management and professional skills, Inadequate infrastructure, High transportation cost, Low productivity of labour, Difficult access to finance, Absence of R&D capability, Inconsistent policies, Access to land."
401,401,"Diversify the economic base with minimal ecolog- ical footprint, Harness and add value to natural resources in a sustainable manner, Increase and diversify exports, Promote Bhutan as an organic brand, Promote industries that build the Brand Bhutan image, Reduce dependency on fossil fuel especially in respect to transportation."
402,402,Financing of the EDP is another vital constraint that needs to be addressed.
403,403,There are two aspects to this.
404,404,"Firstly, given limited domestic resources, the success of the EDP for the formal sector and large business projects is hinged on mobilizing external resources through FDI and alternative financing options."
405,405,"Secondly, access to financing for SMEs and rural enterprises needs to be enhanced."
406,406,"SMEs play an 43 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I important role in employment creation, rural income generation and poverty alleviation."
407,407,"According to the National Statistics Bureau, 98 percent of the 17,642 industries registered as of 2008 fall into the cottage and small category, which underscores the importance of this segment in self-employment and income generation."
408,408,The EDP provides some fiscal incentives to promote these industries though tax holidays.
409,409,"However, small enterprises require more than just tax incentives for startup and moving up the value chain."
410,410,"An actionable strategy to incubate a wide range of potential enterprises, address capacity constraints and provide access to finance and loans for SMEs is vital."
411,411,"All the above require a short, medium and long term strategy given structural, institutional and human resource capacity constraints and the time lag in addressing them."
412,412,"In this regard, the effective engagement of the private sector as a collaborative partner in the design of a clear roadmap for the implementation of the EDP 2010 during the Eleventh Plan period is imperative and will be accorded a high priority."
413,413,"For a country to graduate from LDC, three criteria need to be fulfilled as follows: Income criterion, is assessed on a three-year average estimate of GNI per capita, based on the World Bank Atlas method."
414,414,Human Assets Index (HAI) based on indicators of: (a) nutrition: percentage of population undernourished; (b) health: mortality rate for children aged five years or under; (c) education: the gross secondary school enrolment ratio; and (d) adult literacy rate.
415,415,"Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) based on indicators of: (a) population size; (b) remoteness; (c) merchandise export concentration; (d) share of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in gross domestic product; (e) share of B A C K G R O U N D 01 44 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I population living in low elevated coastal zones; (f) instability of exports of goods and services; (g) victims of natural disasters; and (h) instability of agricultural production."
416,416,"As per the United Nations 2012 country data review11, Bhutan fulfills the income criteria but remains below the graduation threshold on HAI and EVI."
417,417,The challenges confronting HAI include (a) malnutrition among children - almost one in eight children under five in Bhutan are moderately underweight (12.7 percent) and 3.2 percent were classified as severely underweight.
418,418,"More than one third of children (33.5 percent) are moderately stunted or too short for their age, out of which 13.3 percent were severely stunted."
419,419,Wasting is a reflection of acute malnutrition and moderate wasting is estimated at 5.9 percent and severe wasting at 2 percent (BMIS 2010).
420,420,"(b) under five years mortality rate per 1,000 live births remain high at 69 (AHB 2012); (c) adult literacy remains low at 55.3 percent (BLSS 2012)."
421,421,"In terms of EVI, the challenges include (a) population size Small countries have fewer possibilities for economic diversification and when exposed to natural shocks often the whole country is affected."
422,422,"Bhutan with a population of less than 700,000 is vulnerable to such shocks."
423,423,(b) remoteness Bhutan being a landlocked and mountainous country is handicapped by high transportation costs and other constraints of landlocked LDCs that reduce our ability to respond to trade shocks.
424,424,(c) instability of exports of goods and services - Bhutans largest export is hydropower to India followed by exports of mineral and metal based products (where low electricity cost is its comparative advantage).
425,425,"Therefore, our exports are highly vulnerable to hydrological risks and effective functioning of hydropower plants."
426,426,Agriculture products comes a distant third with about 5 percent of total exports.
427,427,"(d) victims of natural disasters threats of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF), landslides, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires and windstorms are real."
428,428,"In the last few years, Bhutan has faced a number of such natural disasters where lives and properties have been lost."
429,429,"11http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/cdp/ldc/profile/country_23.shtml 45 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I With a strong emphasis on improving the health and education outcomes, achieving progress in the HAI may not be a major constraint other than improving the adult literacy rate which may pose a challenge."
430,430,"However, improving the EVI will require special efforts particularly in addressing economic imbalances, productive capacities and diversification challenges."
431,431,"Hence, the goodwill, support and cooperation of our development partner in the coming years will be critical for Bhutan."
432,432,"Furthermore, even beyond 2020, Bhutan may require continued cooperation and support from its development partners to ensure that the transition will help establish a solid economic foundation that is dynamic and resilient."

434,434,"The interplay of fertility, mortality and migration affect not only demographic, economic and social development but also socio-cultural cohesion."
435,435,Understanding the present and future composition of the population and its spatial distribution is necessary for the formulation of people centered Five Year socio- economic development plans.
436,436,"With a floating population of 37,443,the actual resident population of Bhutan was 634,982 persons, of which 52.5 percent were males and 47.5 percent were females, while the rural and urban composition was 69.1 percent and 30.9 percent respectively."
437,437,"Statistical Year Book 2012 (NSB) has estimated a population of 720,679 in 2012 with an average household size of 4.6 and a population growth rate of 1.3 percent."
438,438,"Thimphu was the most densely populated Dzongkhag with a population of 98,676 and a density of 54 persons per square kilometers while Gasa was the least with a population density of 1 person per square kilometer."
439,439,2.1.2 Growth Rate The population growth rate13 has been on the decline from 3.1 per cent in 1994 to 1.3 percent in 2012 (Statistical Yearbook 2012 NSB).
440,440,"If the present trends continues, growth rates are projected to decline to 1.1 percent in 2020, 0.9 percent in 2030 and 0.4 percent in 2050 (Population Projections (2005-2050), Working Committee for draft NPP 2012)."
441,441,"Despite the decline in both mortality and fertility rates, an incremental growth will be experienced due to the population momentum effect which occurs when a large proportion of the population are of child-bearing age."
442,442,"However, if the TFR drops to below replacement level (average of 2.1 surviving children per woman) Bhutan will experience a much slower population growth."
443,443,"Currently, in the absence of a comprehensive National Population Policy efforts have been towards controlling population growth."
444,444,"However, for a country with a small population this could have an adverse impact in terms of security, demographic and socio-economic development."
445,445,The draft National Population Policy has been drafted and will be presented for approval by the Cabinet in the Eleventh Plan.
446,446,The National Population Policy will be the basis for planning a stable and sustainable population growth.

448,448,51 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 2.1.3 Age Structure and Sex Composition The age structure and sex composition of a population is represented by a population pyramid.
449,449,"PHCB 2005 estimates that a large proportion of the population is below the age of 24 years, comprising 56 percent of the total population."
450,450,The narrowing of the base may be indicative of declining births in recent years.
451,451,BLSS 2012 estimates nearly half the population is below 25 years of age.
452,452,"Children (below 15 years of age) accounted for 30 percent of the population, and the elderly (aged 60 and above), about 10 percent."
453,453,The overall gender ratio was 97 males per 100 females.
454,454,"However, this window of opportunity will remain only if we are able to gainfully utilize the youth population to contribute towards productive economic development."
455,455,"2.1.4 Differently-abled Persons The PHCB 2005 revealed that 21,894 persons or 3.4 percent of the total population were differently-abled, of which 45.7 percent were females and 54.3 percent were males."
456,456,"Among the Dzongkhags, Lhuentse and Trongsa had the highest proportion of the differently-abled persons with 6.4 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively."
457,457,The most common forms of disability acquired since birth were speech and hearing.
458,458,"On the other hand, the most common forms of disability acquired after birth are visual and hearing followed by mobility."
459,459,Visual and hearing were more severe among the elderly population (50 years and above) while moving and speech were among the younger population (0-4 years).
460,460,Mental health problems were high in the age group 15-39 years and gradually declined thereafter.
461,461,"15Demographic Bonus is a prominent presence of people in the productive age group (15-64 years), which can contribute to high economic growth due to the favourable Dependability Ratio."
462,462,"Graph 2.3 Population Pyramid BLSS 2012 C U R R EN T SI TU AT IO N 02 52 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Various other reports also suggest prevalence of disability, particularly among children aged 2-9 years, in Bhutan."

464,464,"While Bhutan Multiple Indicator Survey 2010 reports 30.4 percent of children to have at least one disability, with the highest proportion (31.5 percent) living in the eastern region."
465,465,"The disability prevalence was higher among children of illiterate mothers, poor and those living in remote areas."
466,466,"2.1.5 Migration As per PHCB 2005, rural to urban migration (111,770) accounted for the highest population move followed by rural to rural migration (111,548) within the country."
467,467,"There were about 19,992 people who moved from urban to rural areas while 23,874 people moved from urban to urban centres."
468,468,The highest proportion of migrants (31.5 percent) migrated for family reasons.
469,469,"This was followed by 17 percent for employment, 15 percent for education and training, 11 percent due to marriage, 10 percent for work transfer, 3.4 percent for resettlement, 7 percent living with relatives, and the remaining 7 percent for other unspecified reasons."
470,470,"In terms of Dzongkhag-wise net migration, Thimphu received the highest with 39,770 persons and Trashigang had the highest outflow of 16,697 persons."
471,471,"2.1.6 Population Projections 2020, 2030 and 2050 The projections are based on medium variant projection."
472,472,The purpose of presenting this projection is to present the likely scenario in the coming decades.
473,473,"The average annual growth rates implied in the projection is going to decrease during the projection period from a high of 2.1 percent in 2006 to a low of 0.4 percent by 2050, if the fertility is brought to the replacement level of 2.1 (two surviving children per woman) during the period 2005-2020 and remains unchanged thereafter."
474,474,"During the period 2005-2050, the working age population is estimated to grow by around 73.6 per cent."

528,528,"In this respect, the support and cooperation of our development partners will be critical to overcome some of the challenges confronted by Bhutan as follows: The status of MDGs presented below represents national level aggregates and often national level aggregates mask disparities at local levels."

614,614,"About 136 most commonly availed services ranging from civil registration, timber permits, and security clearance were streamlined and automated to reduce the service delivery turn-around-time by 70 percent."
615,615,Online services are made available through 131 Community Centres (CCs) connected with internet and the remaining 74 CCs will provide the service after internet connectivity is established in the Eleventh Plan.
616,616,"Agencification Guidelines 2012 Agencification Guidelines was issued to improve performance and public service delivery by an agency/organization by separating planning and policy-making, regulatory and implementation functions and by facilitating higher flexibility in terms of key organizational processes such as human resource management, procurement, budgeting and performance management."
617,617,"Since the adoption of Agencification Guidelines, 12 new departments under various ministries were created, six government departments were granted autonomous status and four agencies were delinked from the civil service."
618,618,Government Performance Management System (GPMS) was initiated to a) drive clarity of objectives for the Ministry/Dzongkhag; b) enhance accountability and performance; and c) allow efficient resource allocation/utilisation.
619,619,"It maps out tangible targets in terms of outputs, key performance indicators and activities and other essential metrics that will facilitate measuring the performance of all central and local government agencies."
620,620,The full implementation of GPMS across all government agencies will be completed during the Eleventh Plan.
621,621,The system will be used to measure the Key Performance Indicator of average performance rating of government agency targeted at more than 90 percent under the National Key Result Area of Improved Public Service Delivery.
622,622,Efforts will also be made to cascade this to individual levels so that it can be used as the basis for performance evaluation and meritocracy in the civil service.
623,623,"69 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 2.5.3 Transparency, Accountability and Control of Corruption With the introduction of parliamentary democracy and the establishment of various democratic processes, transparency and accountability has been further enhanced with increased public participation in policy making."
624,624,"In addition to the Legislative Committee established in 2003 and Public Accounts Committee established in 2004, 12 new committees were established in 2008 during the First session of First National Assembly."
625,625,The first session of the second Parliament held in September 2013 restructured the existing 14 committees to ten committees.
626,626,"Financial Accountability: To ensure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in use of public resources, annual audit is carried out by the Royal Audit Authority (RAA), a supreme audit institution and a constitutional body that functions independently and reports directly to the Parliament."
627,627,"In 2012, the Royal Audit Authority conducted 600 audits during the year including 500 normal audits, 98 certification audits, 1 performance based audit and 1 thematic audit."
628,628,The irregularities reported decreased to Nu.
629,629,391.007 million in 2012 from Nu.
630,630,"770.141 million in 2011, decrease of 49 percent."
631,631,"The irregularities comprised of 47 percent categorized under Shortfalls, Lapses and Deficiencies, 33 percent under Fraud, Corruption and Embezzlement, 12 percent under Violation of Rules and Regulations and 8 percent under mismanagement."
632,632,The ACCs 2012-13 annual report shows corruption is still a major challenge although peoples perception of the prevalence of corruption is declining.
633,633,"In 2012- 2013, ACC received 449 complaints compared to 458 cases in the previous year."
634,634,"The major areas of complaints were misuse of resources like government property and funds followed by personnel, land, construction and procurement of goods and services."
635,635,"Among the types of corruption, the misuse of authority continues to be a major issue with 564 complaints, followed by embezzlement and nepotism with 397 and 351 complaints respectively."
636,636,C U R R EN T SI TU AT IO N 02 70 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I The National Integrity Assessment (NIA) Survey 201225 reports a national integrity score of 8.37 on a scale of 0-10 (0 means highly corrupt and 10 highly transparent).
637,637,"While corruption perception figures indicate improvements, further efforts will be made towards strengthening and supporting institutions combating corruption as there can be no room for complacency when it comes to addressing this challenge."
638,638,2.5.4 Media Media in Bhutan is fairly young.
639,639,Kuensel and Bhutan Broadcasting Service (BBS) were established in the mid 1980s as the first Bhutanese newspaper and radio station.
640,640,"With the introduction of ICT in the late 1990s, Bhutanese media has grown considerably in all its forms print, broadcast, film, music and internet."
641,641,"Today, there are 12 newspapers, six radio stations, two television news channels, and one entertainment channel."
642,642,The growth of a free and responsible media continues to receive encouragement and support of the government.
643,643,"Print Media - With increasing literacy and changing social needs, a number of private newspapers and magazines were launched."
644,644,With the increased number of newspapers the market for the print media has become competitive.
645,645,"Given the small readership market, advertisement revenues, mainly from government agencies, form the major source of revenue for most newspapers."
646,646,"Consequently, some of the newspapers have either shut operations or suspended print versions due to financial difficulties."
647,647,Radio - Bhutan Broadcasting Service (BBS) is the national public service broadcaster.
648,648,BBS Radio (then known as Radio NYAB) was started in November 1973 by young 25Conducted by Anti Corruption Commission of Bhutan and National Statistics Bureau.
649,649,71 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I volunteers belonging to the National Youth Association of Bhutan.
650,650,"In 1986, with the commissioning of a 10 KW short-wave transmitter and a small broadcast studio, Radio NYAB was renamed Bhutan Broadcasting Service."
651,651,"BBS radio broadcasts for 24 hours in four languages (Dzongkha, Sharchop, Lhotshamkha and English), on both shortwave and FM frequency as well as online."
652,652,"In the last few years, seven private FM Radio Stations , namely Kuzoo FM, Radio Valley, Centennial Radio, Radio High, Radio Waves and Sherubtse College were established."
653,653,"While the FM services and shortwave services of the BBS reach the entire country, Kuzoo FM radio services are available in 18 Dzongkhags, and the remaining radio stations services are currently available only in Thimphu."
654,654,"These new radio services have created a platform for people to voice their concerns, spread awareness and are already addressing a wide range of social issues."
655,655,BBS launched its second TV channel BBS 2 in 2012 which broadcasts current programmes and entertainment shows.
656,656,Cable television services are now available in 19 of the 20 Dzongkhags and more then 40 different channels are provided by the cable TV operators.
657,657,"While the film industry is still in its infancy, the number of Bhutanese films has been increasing with more people venturing into the industry."
658,658,A National Film Policy is currently being drafted in order to provide further impetus to the industry.
659,659,2.5.5 Womens Empowerment and Gender Equality The ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1981 saw the establishment of the National Womens Association of Bhutan (NWAB) with the mandate of addressing the issues related to our women and reporting and monitoring on the progress.
660,660,"Several non-governmental organizations working on womens issues such as Respect, Educate, Nurture and Empower Women (RENEW) and Tarayana Foundation have also been established."
661,661,The seven critical areas identified in the NPAG namely: good governance; economic empowerment; violence against women; education and training; health; prejudices and stereotypes; and ageing mental health and disabilities; provided the platform for addressing gender related issues.
662,662,"The Tenth Plan, also witnessed increased data and statistical evidences; increased collaboration with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) working on the issues of women and an increase in the gender discourse movement, evident through the media discussions (mainstream and social) and comparatively higher levels of incorporation of gender into mainstream sector policies and issues with the implementation of the Governments Policy Protocol."
663,663,"Under the area of good governance significant achievements were made in terms of conducting surveys and studies to identify factors and challenges influencing the participation of our women in governance, creating awareness on their political participation, building capacities for women leaders and providing a platform for networking amongst the women leaders and aspiring leaders."
664,664,"Provision of support services like scholarships for girls from disadvantaged families, establishing girl- friendly infrastructure in the schools, improving boarder facilities and creating an enabling environment were major achievements under the area of education."
665,665,"Establishment of Early Childhood, Care and Development Centres (ECCD) and extended classrooms helped in increasing girls participation in schools."
666,666,"The literacy rate of women increased in the plan period due to the expansion of non- formal education, where over 70 percent of the participants were women, and continuing education programmes."
667,667,"The critical area of womens economic empowerment witnessed increased participation of women in economic activities through the provision of various support like capacity building, entrepreneurial skills development, business management programmes and formation of farmers groups, cooperatives and self- help groups and the provision of micro credit."
668,668,"However, womens lower participation in regular paid employment (6.1 percent as compared to 17.8 percent for men) and substantial engagement in agricultural occupations (38.2 percent against 23.7 percent for men) and the fact that 73 percent26 of our employed women are in the 26Labour Force Survey, 2012, Ministry of Labour and Human Resources."
669,669,73 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I agricultural sector warrants further assessment and special interventions on skills development and other economic empowerment measures.
670,670,"Progress has been forged in the area of providing social safety for women in the workplace through the enactment of the Labour and Employment Act 2007, although enforcement may need to be strengthened in the Eleventh Plan."
671,671,"Creating awareness among the health personnel and the general public on gender related aspects of health, HIV and AIDS, teenage pregnancy, adolescent health amongst others have seen good progress over the last five years."
672,672,"Further, significant achievements were made to eliminate violence against women (VAW) through awareness and sensitization programs, provision of counseling and legal services and establishment of shelter services for the victims of VAW."
673,673,"The expansion of women and child protection units in 4 police stations, up gradation of complaints and response mechanism and establishment of women friendly judicial procedures were additional achievements."
674,674,"The platform for planning and programming in the Eleventh Plan is provided by the findings and recommendations of the review of the NPAG and the Gender Equality Diagnostic Study of Selected Sectors (GEDSS) namely Education, Urban Development, Environment, Energy, Private Sector, Transport, Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods, and Work and Unemployment."
675,675,"Other strategies in the Eleventh Plan would include: creating a gender responsive legal environment through development of a Gender Equality Law including special temporary measures such as quotas to enhance womens participation in governance; implementation of the Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting Strategy; strengthening gender mainstreaming initiatives/capacity at all levels including the private sector; collecting and using sex-disaggregated data; awareness programs at all levels; enhancing womens participation in employment and economic activities; and effective monitoring and implementation of current laws, rules and regulations, policies, plans and programs."
676,676,2.5.6 Promotion and Protection of Child Rights Firm commitment has been given towards protecting our children and implementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) by aligning national legislations to related articles in the Convention.
677,677,"Article 9.18 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan 2008 reaffirms the states duties by committing to take appropriate C U R R EN T SI TU AT IO N 02 74 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I measures to ensure that children are protected against all forms of discrimination and exploitation including trafficking, prostitution, abuse, violence, degrading treatment and economic exploitation."
678,678,The plan period witnessed a landmark achievement in the Child Protection area with the conduct of a mapping and assessment of the Child Protection System in Bhutan and the development of a National Plan of Action for Child Protection in Bhutan.
679,679,"The assessment clearly indicated current child protection issues, challenges faced and recommendations."
680,680,"The following six priority areas for focus will be addressed in the eleventh plan in order to ensure systematic and effective prevention and response to child protection issues: Law, policies, standards and regulations Service and service delivery mechanisms across a continuum of care Capacity and resources (human, financial and infrastructure) Coordination, collaboration and accountability Communication and advocacy Knowledge management The enactment of major laws namely the Child Care and Protection Act 2011 and the Child Adoption Act of Bhutan 2012 was a major achievement."
681,681,"Other legislations such as the Labour and Employment Act 2007, Marriage Act 1980, Inheritance Act 1980, Citizenship Act 1985 and Royal Bhutan Police Act 2009 also address relevant child issues."
682,682,The National Youth Policy has actively included children and called for their inclusion in all future discourse that concerns them.
683,683,"Young people such as Young Volunteers in Action (YVIA), Scouts Association of Bhutan and Druk Adolescents Initiative on Sexual Awareness Network (DAISAN) have been formed to inform policy makers on their concerns and to integrate them into sector policies."
684,684,New partnerships between young people and government agencies such as the Police-Youth Partnership have paved the way for more meaningful dialogue and engagement.
685,685,The educational needs of differently-abled children were addressed through integrative education initiated in five schools and establishment of new NGOs.
686,686,Besides the regular teaching programme other skills development trainings 75 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I were also provided for these children.
687,687,Special educational needs and early childhood care and development are vital components under the draft National Education Policy for Bhutan.
688,688,"2.5.7 Civil Society Organizations (CSO) With the enactment of Civil Society Organizations Act, 2007 and subsequent establishment of the Civil Society Organizations Authority in 2009 the number of CSOs have grown."
689,689,"CSOs are in key areas of education, health, women, children, culture, environmental protection, and private sector development."
690,690,"Presently there are 30 registered CSOs27, of which 24 are Public Benefit Organizations and 6 Mutual Benefit Organizations."
691,691,CSOs complement the efforts of the government in provision of certain services that the government is unable to deliver or services that can be delivered more effectively by such organizations.
692,692,"CSOs like Tarayana Foundation have contributed in addressing the local needs of disadvantaged remote communities through livelihood enhancement programmes such as skills training in traditional paper making, traditional clay pot making, nettle weaving, soap and candle making, refining cane and bamboo crafts, etc, housing support to remote communities like Lhops in south western Bhutan, and microfinance etc."
693,693,"Bhutan Youth Development Fund provides financial support for youth development activities like leadership skills, drug rehabilitation, special education, basic skills and vocational training, advocacy research and education."
694,694,"RENEW (Respect, Educate, Nurture and Empower Women) is dedicated to empowerment of women and girls in Bhutan, especially the victims and survivors of domestic violence."
695,695,"Draktsho aspires to ensure young persons with Disabilities in Bhutan have quality opportunities for developing skills for life and vocation, and for becoming self- reliant, make a living and lead a contended life overcoming barriers created gender or other differences Many other CSOs have contributed towards addressing various issues such as HIV/ AIDS, Environment, Media etc."
696,696,"In the Eleventh Plan, the government will work together with the CSOs to realize the plan objectives."

698,698,"C U R R EN T SI TU AT IO N 02 76 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 2.5.8 Mainstreaming of Cross-Cutting Issues The growing environmental, social and economic issues like environmental degradation, over utilization of natural resources, climate change, issues of poverty, gender, differently-abled, unemployment and income, food and nutrition, health and sanitation and changing nature of natural disasters pose serious threats to our hard earned developmental and economic gains and momentum and to our goal of sustainable development."
699,699,"Recognizing the fact that these issues are all cross-cutting and inextricably linked to the overall developmental process, it is imperative that all socio-economic and environmental cross-cutting issues/ concerns are addressed systematically through mainstream development by integrating them in our decision making processes of policy making, planning and budgeting right at the outset rather than after environmental, social and economic degradation has already occurred."
700,700,"The mainstreaming of cross cutting issues is to enhance environmental, social and economic conditions in an integrated manner through smart developmental management and interventions for the effective realization of Eleventh Plan goals and for GNH-based development focused on real life outcomes."
701,701,It will also support recognizing environment as a finite resource for all development but one that presents great opportunity if managed in an integrated manner that exploits all synergies to address important issues.
702,702,"Towards this end in the Eleventh Plan, the central level Mainstreaming Reference Group will provide advisory and other mainstreaming support while sectors and local governments whose mainstreaming capacity has been built will be responsible for effective mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues in policy making, planning, budgeting and implementation."
703,703,"In the Eleventh Plan efforts will be made towards strengthening and institutionalizing the mainstreaming process at all levels of decision making, planning and implementation."
704,704,The mainstreaming tool (six steps process) and framework which was developed for sectors and local governments will provide support and guidance to the central and local level.
705,705,"Although some effects of the global downturn did manifest in the form of reduced tourism revenue and industrial exports, the domestic economy remained largely unscathed due to its limited integration with the global economy and growth remained buoyant mainly due to huge investments in the hydropower sector."
706,706,"While in most countries, the global downturn had a pronounced impact on marginalized groups through increased unemployment and erosion of savings, Bhutan saw a drop in its unemployment rate and the Governments poverty reduction efforts remained largely on track since most of the poverty stricken in Bhutan are subsistence farmers isolated from the formal economy."
707,707,"Although Bhutan weathered the global economic crisis well, the economy experienced an unprecedented macroeconomic policy challenge arising from a successive build-up of current account deficits with India and consequently an acute and persistent shortfall in Rupee reserves."
708,708,"The remedial policy measures undertaken to address the Rupee shortfall caused a severe tightening of the credit market, which adversely affected private investment and growth in the latter half of the Tenth Plan period."
709,709,"The lingering Rupee shortfall and consequent credit crunch in the financial system has given rise to major challenges, affecting both households and key sectors of the economy, and is expected to spill over into the Eleventh Plan period."
710,710,Managing the rupee shortage is therefore of high priority to ensure a sound macroeconomic policy framework for effective implementation of the Eleventh Plan.
711,711,Achieving the Eleventh Plan goal of Self-reliance and inclusive green socio-economic development will require a strong macroeconomic framework.
712,712,"Globally, recent conventional macroeconomic policies have been geared towards stability through inflation targeting and fiscal sustainability."
713,713,"However, there is now an increasing consensus that in developing countries macroeconomic frameworks must strike a balance between stabilization targets and broader development objectives."
714,714,"While stability shall continue to form a cornerstone of macroeconomic objectives since it is a necessary condition for the achievement of other objectives, the Eleventh Plan shall additionally focus on creating an enabling environment for growth that is inclusive and sustainable and leads to self-reliance."
715,715,"Hence, microeconomic strategies shall have to be aligned with the macroeconomic objectives."
716,716,"In this M A C R O -E C O N O M IC S IT U AT IO N A N D O U TL O O K 03 80 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I regard, the conditions and strategies to facilitate diversification of the economic base, employment-intensive sectors with enormous potential for backward and forward linkages shall be explored."
717,717,To ensure credit is channelled towards such purposes priority sector lending shall be adopted.
718,718,"On the fiscal front, efforts to enhance the tax base and creation of fiscal space shall be pursued in addition to exploring fiscal incentives for economic activities that generate employment and are carbon neutral."
719,719,"Finally, the establishment of a Stabilization Fund with multi- faceted purposes that serve monetary as well as fiscal policy and investment objectives shall be explored given the relevance of such mechanisms in resource- dependent countries."
720,720,"3.1.1 Real Sector Despite growth having been lower than forecast in the Tenth Plan, the economy rendered a strong performance with real growth rate averaging 8 percent per annum over the five years of the Plan."
721,721,"Poverty also declined from 23 percent in 2007 to 12 percent as of 2012, well beyond the Plan target."
722,722,"Table 3.1 Tenth Plan Economic Targets and Outcomes Real Sector 10FYP Target 10FYP Outcome GDP Growth 9% 8.0% Agriculture 4% 1.5% Industry 9.8% 7.0% Electricity 7.4% 1.9% Construction 15.2% 13.1% Service 7.2% 10.9% Investment (% of GDP) 53.6% Consumption (% of GDP) 65.8% Per capita GDP (USD) 2,590 (2011) Overall Inflation 7.7% Unemployment Rate 2.5% 2.1% Source: MTFF (July 2013) 81 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I However, growth continues to be driven largely by government spending and investment."
723,723,"The industrial sector continues to be dominated by a few large state owned enterprises, mostly under the umbrella of Druk Holding Investments (DHI), with the hydropower subsector constituting almost 20 percent of GDP."
724,724,"The manufacturing subsector accounts for only one-fifth of the industrial sector output, and is narrowly concentrated in food processing and cottage industries."
725,725,"The lack of economic diversification has resulted in a situation of high growth rates driven by the hydropower sector without a commensurate increase in gainful employment for a rapidly growing and educated labour force, which poses significant macroeconomic challenges."
726,726,The aspirations of the Economic Development Policy 2010 and FDI Policy 2010 aimed at diversification of the economy and fostering a vibrant private sector remains largely unfulfilled due to numerous supply side challenges.
727,727,"An ADB28 study have revealed that the sophistication level of Bhutans exports have remained stagnant over the years and that market failures exist, thereby deterring private investment."
728,728,A product space analysis of Bhutan also reveals an inherent difficulty in economic diversification because the capabilities used in the current basket of products are not easily transferrable to other products.
729,729,This provides a strong rationale for the government to lead efforts towards economic diversification and to develop backward and forward linkages in the industrial sector.
730,730,"During the Eleventh Plan period, DHI will play a strategic role in exploring new products, business models and market strategies."
731,731,"With three new hydropower projects expected to begin generation by 2017-18, a key strategy would be to develop export oriented power intensive industries by harnessing the availability of cheap and reliable power rather than simply exporting electricity as a primary product."
732,732,"In this regard, establishing the necessary infrastructure and creating an enabling environment will be crucial for success."
733,733,"Initiatives such as RISE (Rapid Investments in Selective Enterprises), where end-to-end support will be provided for about five select sectors that have potential for vertical integration, value addition and job generation will form the cornerstone of the governments diversification strategy."
734,734,"Savings, Investment and Consumption - Although Bhutans Gross Domestic Savings have displayed a better trend than its South Asian neighbours, the level of savings has been inadequate to finance the significantly higher investment rate."
735,735,"A development constraints study by the ADB revealed that while Bhutan had a high domestic savings rate of 33.7 percent, this was inadequate to support an investment rate of 52.3 percent."
736,736,82 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I The high level of savings at the national level is also mainly a result of government investments and savings of state owned enterprises and is not necessarily a good indicator of household savings.
737,737,"Despite the unavailability of data, it can be surmised that savings at the household level is low considering the stage of development and average disposable income of households."
738,738,"This is also borne out by the fact that household final consumption expenditure grew by an average of 11.3 percent during 2007-2010, outpacing the GDP growth rate."
739,739,Key factors for low household savings rate in Bhutan include a lack of credible savings instruments and incentives.
740,740,"More challenging than the level of savings is the high volatility in the trend of Gross Domestic Savings, as is evident from the data for the period 2005-2012 in the table below."
741,741,Savings witnessed the most significant decline in the fiscal year 2008/09 recording a negative growth of 5.73 percent while its growth peaked in 2010/11 at 43.17 percent.
742,742,"While such volatility in savings is probably inevitable due to the small size of the domestic economy and is linked to the colossal size of public investments, it poses a significant macroeconomic policy challenge as savings is a key determinant of credit growth and investment."
743,743,"A key issue, therefore, in addition to the level of domestic savings is how the savings can be made less volatile, more predictable and effectively intermediated through the financial sector to promote private investments."
744,744,"Source: MTFF (July 2013) Similarly, the high investment rate that has been driving growth also needs to be assessed in light of the declining returns to capital that can be attributed to a combination of factors such as inefficiencies in spending, high import content of 83 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I capital investments and the recent surge in investments on roads and hydropower for which the returns would only be realized in the future."
745,745,"As is empirically observed globally, consumption expenditure has constituted a greater share of GDP than investment."
746,746,"However, investment has displayed significant volatility which is partly attributable to volatile domestic savings and the colossal size of investments relative to GDP."
747,747,"Moreover, hydropower investments thus far have been externally financed, with limited contribution of domestic savings."
748,748,This is inevitable in an economy where the public sector is significantly larger than the private sector.
749,749,"In comparison to other South Asian economies, Bhutan records the highest share of Government consumption and investment as a percentage of GDP (ADB, 2012)."
750,750,Government consumption is primarily driven by expenditure incurred for the social sectors of health and education and investment is dominated largely by hydropower construction and infrastructure.
751,751,A positive trend can be observed in that the growth rate of Gross Domestic Capital Formation has consistently outpaced the growth rate of consumption.
752,752,In comparison to the Ninth Plan Period investment has displayed a significantly higher growth rates which reflect the huge investments in infrastructure and growth in housing.
753,753,Source: MTFF (July 2013) M A C R O -E C O N O M IC S IT U AT IO N A N D O U TL O O K 03 84 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I The percentage contributions to GDP of the various demand side variables also corroborate the high volatility of the components.
754,754,"However, it is encouraging to note that despite Gross Domestic Capital Formation constituting a smaller share of GDP, its percentage contribution to Nominal GDP growth has been the most significant with an average of 12.13 percentage points over the Tenth Plan period."
755,755,Table 3.2 Contribution to GDP Growth Rate Percentage contribution to GDP growth rate of 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 Consumption 13.35 11.62 5.45 7.15 8.63 Gross Domestic Capital Formation 6.96 13.04 19.69 12.93 8.04 Resource Balance -9.01 -9.32 -6.92 -11.37 -11.21 NGDP growth 11.30 15.34 18.21 15.45 11.95 Source: Calculation based on MTFF Empirical evidence suggests that countries achieve a higher level of per capita income and higher standards of living through productivity enhancing capital accumulation and improvement in total factor productivity.
756,756,"As such, it is necessary to weigh the relative returns on different types of capital investments during the Eleventh Plan period and how these investments enhance labour and total factor productivity (TFP)."
757,757,"The Eleventh Plan and EDP 2010 would need to prioritize non-hydropower related capital investments to prevent excessive dependence on hydropower, improve productivity and competitiveness and facilitate diversification of the economy taking into account Bhutans potential and dynamic competitive advantages."
758,758,"Inflation - As the economy has grown and incomes have increased largely due to hydropower investments and government development projects, the wealth effect and availability of credit has translated into a surge in imports due to increasing domestic absorption amid limited domestic production capacity."
759,759,This has exerted huge pressure on the current account and subsequently on our reserves.
760,760,"Given limited domestic capacity it is also hypothesized that the Bhutanese economy is functioning above its potential output level, putting upward pressures on prices and wages and possibly making the real exchange rate over-valued thereby making manufacturing export potentially less competitive."
761,761,Inflation measured by CPI averaged about 7.7 percent per annum during the Tenth Plan.
762,762,The year-on-year inflation rate was highest in the 2nd quarter of 2012 recording 13.53 percent and since then it has been on the decline.
763,763,"85 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Graph 3.3 Year on Year Inflation Source: NSB, 2013 It is envisaged that highly focused economic initiatives in the Eleventh Plan, which include the establishment of a Stabilization Fund, will mitigate the risks of a Dutch disease situation in Bhutan and help stabilize the real exchange rate by sterilizing inflows and facilitating diversification."
764,764,3.1.2 External Sector Bhutan continues to be a net importer of goods and services.
765,765,"The Tenth Plan period witnessed high volatility and a widening of the current account deficit, ranging from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 27.6 percent in 2010/11, culminating in an acute shortage of Indian Rupee (INR) reserves."
766,766,"While exports increased by 30.5 percent in the last five years (2008/09 - 2012/13), imports grew by 132 percent during the same period mainly due to an increase in import of machinery and other inputs for hydropower related construction."
767,767,"Additionally, the rapid expansion of credit for consumption has largely translated into imports."
768,768,"Although the overall balance of payments position during the Tenth Plan has been positive, with successive Capital Account surpluses averaging Nu."
769,769,"15.6 billion annually financing the Current Account deficits, close to 74 percent of the Net Capital inflows came in the form of external borrowings."
770,770,The external sector position is expected to deteriorate during the peak construction period of ongoing and new hydro power plants.
771,771,Hence the current trends in external imbalances M A C R O -E C O N O M IC S IT U AT IO N A N D O U TL O O K 03 86 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I need to be assessed in a broader and longer term context of increasing and diversifying the export base.
772,772,The magnitude of the external imbalances is further amplified by the small size of the economy and the colossal investments required for harnessing hydropower.
773,773,"Although these short-term debts are liquidated as and when there is a corresponding INR inflow, they come at a considerably high interest rate of 10 percent."
774,774,"A key issue arising from the external imbalances is that of defending the Ngultrum- INR peg, which is the cornerstone of Bhutans monetary policy."
775,775,This has become extremely challenging given the magnitude of the imbalances in recent years which have necessitated costly short-term borrowings.
776,776,"As such we need to explore other financing instruments to meet external imbalances, fiscal instruments that limit the propensity to import to a sustainable level and provide incentives for import substitution and export growth."
777,777,The situation of the Bhutanese economy can be illustrated using the twin deficits approach.
778,778,"With high investment rates, Gross Domestic Savings have not been sufficient to finance investment resulting in a current account deficit."
779,779,The direction of both series has been highly correlated as can be seen from the graph.
780,780,Similarly the fiscal balance which also includes loans availed for hydro power contributed to the current account deficit.
781,781,"87 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Graph 3.4 Twin Deficit Source: GNHC (PPD, 2013) The establishment of a stabilization fund is being explored to address the challenges of the external sector by stabilizing the current account imbalances through an array of investment activities such as the issuance of INR denominated bonds."
782,782,This lingering problem that has spilled over into the Eleventh Plan has prompted the need for monetary policy objectives to be better aligned with the longer term development objectives of the country.
783,783,"Of particular significance in the monetary sector has been the high growth in broad money (M2) during the Tenth Plan period, outpacing GDP growth rate by a factor of four."
784,784,"The high growth can largely be explained by the surge in short-term deposits in the banking system, which in turn contributed to a rapid expansion of domestic credit."
785,785,"M A C R O -E C O N O M IC S IT U AT IO N A N D O U TL O O K 03 88 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Graph 3.5 Money Supply Source: MTFF (July 2013) This rapid expansion of domestic credit, averaging 32.3 percent annually from 2008 to 2012, and its composition, has largely translated into imports, thereby exerting pressure on the peg and draining of INR reserves."
786,786,"Currently, personal, housing and construction loans account for the largest share of credit in the economy, both of which invariably lead to imports."
787,787,"In 2007, Bhutan had the lowest domestic credit to GDP ratio in South Asia but has today surpassed that of Sri Lanka or Pakistan."
788,788,89 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Central banks typically sterilize inflows or use various types of macro-prudential tools to contain excessive credit growth to minimize the destabilizing impact on the real economy.
789,789,"The decomposition of credit and deposits reveals that banks have borrowed short term and lent long term reflecting an asset liability mismatch, which is evident from the fact that since 2009 time deposits have stagnated while credit has increased significantly."
790,790,"Hence, addressing the current challenges in the monetary sector require policy interventions that encourage credit to be channeled to productive sectors and incentives to encourage long term savings such as tax exemption on interest earnings from time deposits."
791,791,Source: ADB (2013) Another challenge of the monetary sector is that the banking sector is characterized by high volatility in its liquidity.
792,792,"For instance, excess liquidity in the system ranged from a peak of Nu."
793,793,4.5 billion in 2012 to a low of negative Nu.
794,794,The average excess liquidity during the period 2008-2012 was Nu.
795,795,2.69 billion but the standard deviation was an alarming Nu.
796,796,The volatility coefficient for this period was 0.76 implying that the average volatility swung to as high as 76 percent of the average excess liquidity.
797,797,This warrants the deployment of monetary policy tools to ensure a stable level of liquidity and avoid excess liquidity that can DecJunDecJunDecJunDecJunDecJunDecJunDecJunDecJunDec 20052006200720082009201020112012Year M A C R O -E C O N O M IC S IT U AT IO N A N D O U TL O O K 03 90 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I lead to reckless lending.
798,798,"Moreover, a stable level of liquidity is crucial to promote investments by the private sector."
799,799,"Table 3.3 Banking Sector Liquidity 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Excess liquidity 3125.6 2598.1 4379.4 -1130.8 4500 Average 2694.46 Standard deviation 2045.81 Volatility 0.76 Source: GNHC (PPD, 2013) Furthermore, it needs to be verified whether the surge in unsterilized hydro-related inflows and other Official Development Assistance inflows through the same logic, are sparking off a credit multiplier effect and consequently the growing current account deficits and persistent shortfall in the INR reserves."
800,800,"These inflows, which ultimately exit the economy after a brief time lag, remain unsterilized; and within this short period leads to an expansion of short term deposits that invariably result in an expansion of the money supply."
801,801,"In which case, establishing a stabilization fund would be critical to effectively sterilizing the large inflows and preventing the money multiplier effect in the banking system."
802,802,"Monitoring credit allocation and ensuring that they are channeled in the right direction will be critical to addressing the negative impacts of credit expansion, particularly on the external sector."
803,803,The ADB recommends interim measures that target credit demand rather than supply.
804,804,"In this regard, fiscal incentives will play a critical role in diverting credit away from non-productive sectors to more productive sectors that generate employment and enhance exports."
805,805,"Similarly, a stronger and proactive promotion of the capital market is critical to channel the savings of the public to more productive purposes."
806,806,"Currently, industries are more inclined to borrow at exorbitant interest rates from banks in the absence of incentives for capital market listings."
807,807,"Providing fiscal incentives for stock market listings and re- investment in shares would, in addition to encouraging and channeling savings towards productive purposes, also enhance transparency and productivity."
808,808,The UNDESA recommends the adoption of an Asset Based Reserve Requirement system to channel credit towards priority sectors.
809,809,The RMA is already in the process of formulating a priority sector lending policy which will provide the much needed 91 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I impetus to promote exports and employment.
810,810,Such coordinated measures that involve monetary tools and fiscal incentives for financial sector vibrancy are crucial to address the current challenges in the monetary sector.
811,811,An important aspect of monetary policy in Bhutan involves the management of foreign reserves.
812,812,Convertible currency constitutes close to 90 percent of our foreign reserves despite the fact that the major share of our current account transactions are denominated in INR with approximately 90 percent of our exports and 70 percent of imports being with India.
813,813,The lingering INR shortfall and its effects on the economy provide a compelling argument for a more dynamic reserve management system that takes into consideration an appropriate ratio in the composition of our reserves between INR and other convertible currencies.
814,814,"According to the UNDESA study, holding a sufficient portion of reserves in INR would also provide some level of cushioning to address the mismatch in the timing of inflows and outflows of INR and thereby avoid a reactive liquidation of USD."
815,815,"The study shows that although huge current account deficits surfaced in earlier years, no alarm was created because the central bank maintained adequate INR reserves."
816,816,3.1.4 Fiscal Sector The governments fiscal performance has also come under scrutiny in the wake of the INR crunch.
817,817,It has been argued that excessive spending by the government resulted in huge current account deficits and consequently the INR crunch.
818,818,Government spending also leads to a multiplier effect that increases aggregate demand and ultimately imports given the limited domestic productive capacity.
819,819,It is felt that the large investments of the government have resulted in an overheating of the economy.
820,820,Amid such concerns there have been calls to tighten fiscal spending considering the governments dominant presence in the economy.
821,821,"With government expenditure averaging 39 percent of nominal GDP, and given the colossal nature of recent investments such as the Punatsangchu I amounting to nearly 100 percent of GDP, such concerns are not without merit."
822,822,"Moreover, the concentration of these investments in the same time period has also given rise to concerns that they contribute to the liquidity crunch."
823,823,"However, the counterargument is that the impact of the governments expenditure on the current account is offset to a large extent by corresponding inflows of aid and revenue from hydropower sales."
824,824,It also needs to be highlighted that the M A C R O -E C O N O M IC S IT U AT IO N A N D O U TL O O K 03 92 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I governments fiscal approach has been generally prudent with the budget deficit never exceeding GDP growth rates.
825,825,"Moreover, curtailing of the government investments in much needed public infrastructure and services would undermine Bhutans pursuit of inclusive growth and sustainable development."
826,826,"Nevertheless, various reforms are required to broaden the tax base, rein in unproductive and recurrent expenditure and manage the current macroeconomic imbalances."
827,827,Enhanced fiscal management will be crucial for a smooth transition away from an aid driven economy and to achieve the Eleventh Plan goal of self-reliance.
828,828,"While revenue mobilization has been commendable, averaging 23 percent of GDP over the Tenth Plan, this falls far short of government expenditure."
829,829,"During the Tenth Plan, official development assistance accounted for an average of 14 percent of GDP."
830,830,Bhutans improved socio-economic indicators will result in an eventual phasing out of aid by development partner for which the government must be prepared.
831,831,Enhancing government revenues to fill in the expected decline in aid will be crucial to sustain the high rate of GDP growth.

834,834,"Although most of the debt thus far has been channeled towards self-liquidating hydro investments, the recent surge in short term debt availed to address INR liquidity shortages have become a cause for serious concern."
835,835,"Source: MTFF (July 2013) The fiscal deficit during the Eleventh Plan has been targeted at 3 percent of GDP, excluding the construction of debt financed hydropower projects."
836,836,"This is far more stringent than the 6.75 percent targeted in the Tenth Plan, which is mainly to ensure that the government limits deficit financing from the domestic market M A C R O -E C O N O M IC S IT U AT IO N A N D O U TL O O K 03 94 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I which is already facing a severe liquidity crunch and also to avoid crowding out of private sector investments."
837,837,Alignment of Monetary and Fiscal Policies - The macroeconomic challenges that transpired during the Tenth Plan period have highlighted the need for effective coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities.
838,838,"For a small open economy like Bhutan, such coordination is critical to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment through periodic joint assessments of the real, fiscal and monetary sectors; formulation of mutually reinforcing preventive measures; and ensuring effective remedial measures during times of crisis."
839,839,The lingering INR crunch has brought the importance and need for such coordination to the fore.
840,840,"For instance, instead of RMAs moratoria on various forms of lending to discourage imports, a viable policy alternative was the imposition of adequately large taxes, which fiscal authorities were politically constrained in imposing."
841,841,Coherence between monetary and fiscal policies is also critical for the smooth implementation of development projects.
842,842,"Based on fiscal outlays, monetary authorities need to undertake prudent liquidity management to ensure reliable access to credit by the private sector."
843,843,Coordination is also crucial in ensuring the sustainability of the currency peg.
844,844,"Given Bhutans stage of development, fiscal spending and to a certain extent deficits, are critical to deliver growth."
845,845,Hence a trade-off needs to be arrived at between monetary targets and growth priorities.
846,846,"A moderate level of inflation is acceptable for Bhutan, given the infrastructure investment requirements and the low level of urbanization."
847,847,"It is argued that in the case of Bhutan, monetary policy is redundant or has minimal leverage given that inflation is largely an exogenous phenomenon due to the pegged exchange rate regime."
848,848,"Various studies provide evidence, that the non- tradable sector has been growing and inflationary pressure has been building in the sector, which is mainly a result of monetary and fiscal expansion."
849,849,"Moreover, in addition to price stability, central banks, particularly in developing countries, have a critical role in maintaining financial system stability, safeguarding the balance of external payments and more promoting broader socio-economic development goals."
850,850,Ensuring efficient exchange of information between key government agencies that would improve coordination of fiscal and monetary policies.
851,851,Assessment of the availability of credit/liquidity by RMA to ensure smooth implementation of development projects by the private sector which is dependent on credit.
852,852,Deliberate and formulate strategies and policies for achieving public debt and monetary management objectives.
853,853,In this regard the MFCC needs to be strengthened in order to meet the above mentioned objectives and serve as a competent economic advisory body that ensures convergence of diverse policies to achieve broader national goals.
854,854,Given the pace of economic growth and increasing macroeconomic challenges a business as usual approach will further jeopardize the health of the economy.

856,856,This is based on the assumption that the hydro power projects in the pipe line are completed as scheduled.
857,857,"The real GDP growth rate is expected to spike to 17.36 and 24 per cent towards the end of the plan period, driven primarily by the industry sector, which is expected to grow by 30.8 percent and 42.5 percent in the last two years of the Plan due to the commissioning of three mega projects."
858,858,"The services sector is expected to sustain consistent growth rates averaging about 9 percent per annum, primarily fuelled by tourism and the expanding non-tradable sector."
859,859,"The growth in the primary sector is expected to remain moderate, at less than 2 percent per annum."
860,860,"While the projections show a very optimistic growth scenario, the macroeconomic challenges of recent years underscores the need to prudently address various issues in the real, external and monetary sectors."
861,861,"Given the huge revenue gains expected from the hydropower sector, there is also a growing imperative for preventive measures against the phenomenon of Dutch disease."
862,862,"In this regard, the prudent management and use of hydropower inflows towards an effective strategy for economic diversification, productivity enhancement through knowledge and skills development and employment creation will be critical."

870,870,"The contribution of FDI to the capital account is projected to decline in the Eleventh Plan, despite the increase in its absolute value during the last years of the Plan."
871,871,As highlighted earlier these inflows will not be able to finance the deficit for the five year period.

873,873,"99 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Source: MTFF (July 2013) While deterioration in the Current Account deficit is mainly attributable to investments in the hydro power sector, the debt for which are self-servicing once projects are commissioned, the following issues are a matter of concern: National savings are not adequate to finance the level of investment in the economy."
874,874,"Hence, external borrowing is inevitable."
875,875,"However, the deterioration of the current account is not only attributable to rising investment but also due to declining savings."
876,876,"A recent study by ADB notes that GDS plummeted to 16.1 percent of GDP in 2008 due to the financial crisis, but started to recover in 2009 and 2010, yet they are still below pre-crisis levels."

946,946,The rationale for such an aspiration is motivated by an understanding of Bhutans current situation and priorities and its alignment to the GNH based development path.
947,947,"The first element of self-reliance is crucial in many dimensions: First, our economy while achieving robust growth rates over the last decade is still import driven, has a narrow tax base that is largely dependent on hydropower revenues and low levels of productive employment though the overall unemployment rates reported is commendable."
948,948,"Secondly, with the improved socio-economic indicators, some of our traditional development partners have already indicated their desire to phase out development assistance from Bhutan."
949,949,"Hence the urgency to pursue the self-reliance objective that transforms our economy to a more diversified economy that creates productive employment opportunities, ensures a broader tax base and provides an enabling environment for private sector development."
950,950,The second element of Inclusive Development refers to reducing poverty and inequality by enhancing the standard of living and the quality of life of the most vulnerable sections of our society.
951,951,"While our poverty and social indicators report significant progress, disparities exist within regions, area of residence and gender."
952,952,The Eleventh Plan will ensure inclusiveness by targeting the disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of our population so that all sections of our population enjoy the benefits of socio-economic development.
953,953,"As in the past plans, an important cross cutting principle shall be the continued adoption of rigorous environmental standards in the pursuit of our development objectives."
954,954,Hence the plan shall ensure the mainstreaming and incorporation of Green or Carbon Neutral strategies in all our activities.
955,955,4.2 National Key Result Areas (NKRAs)/Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) National Key Result Areas (NKRAs) are outcomes at the national level that the government needs to achieve over the next five years in order to realize the Eleventh Plan objective of Self Reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development.

1154,1154,"PlaMS, a web based system, is used by all the Planning Officers, Program and Project Managers of Ministries, autonomous agencies, Dzongkhags and Gewogs for managing the results based five year plan programs, preparing annual work plans based on the approved five year plans, and to track plan performance on a weekly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual basis."
1155,1155,131 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I MYRB is used by Budget Officers in all RGOB budgetary agencies to manage annual and rolling budgets while the PEMS is used by all the Accounts Officers in various Government agencies to manage public expenditure on a real time basis.
1156,1156,Both the systems are web based solutions.
1157,1157,"The use of the integrated system by all government agencies commenced from July 2013, which coincided with the start of the first fiscal year of the Eleventh Plan."
1158,1158,"The integrated system is aimed at making planning, budgeting and progress monitoring more effective and less cumbersome."
1159,1159,"As depicted in the figure below, the integrated planning, budgeting and expenditure management system provides a powerful and comprehensive platform for results based planning and monitoring."

1206,1206,"According to the Survey, the adjusted Net Primary Attendance Ratio (NAR) for 2010 indicates that Punakha, Chukha, Mongar, Lhuentse, Wangdue and Gasa are the six Dzongkhags that have the lowest adjusted NAR, significantly below the national average of 91.9 percent."
1207,1207,"Similarly, the Gender Parity Index (GPI) reveals that Pemagatshel, Trongsa, Haa, Punakha and Mongar have a variance in their GPI scores by more than 0.03 from 1.0, indicating that some inequity exist in terms of gender participation."
1208,1208,"In all of these five Dzongkhags, the participation level of girls in primary education significantly exceeds that of boys."
1209,1209,"However, these ratios change in favor of male children as students move to higher classes mainly due to higher drop-out rates among female students."

1211,1211,"Relevance and Quality of Education: In spite of the significant progress made with regard to providing access to education, the quality of education is an issue of growing concern to parents and policy makers."
1212,1212,"Judging solely by improvements in efficiency indicators such as drop-out rates, repetition rates, completion rates and survival rates, the quality of education has certainly improved over the years, although some of these rates, such as repetition and dropout rates in class IV and VII, are still undesirably high and need further improvement."
1213,1213,"However, what remains of great concern is that an increasing numbers of our students, including graduates from vocational and tertiary institutions, are inadequately prepared to enter the workforce."
1214,1214,"On the other hand Bhutan continues to face an acute shortage of skilled and highly specialized manpower such as doctors, engineers, ICT experts and teachers."
1215,1215,This has resulted in a paradoxical situation of relatively high levels of youth unemployment and a critical skills shortage at the same time.
1216,1216,"Furthermore, the rapid socio-economic development and transformative changes that have been taking place, both domestically and globally, require higher standards in education at a scale that has never been met or required before."
1217,1217,"The fact that most of our students are unable to meet the admission criteria of top tier tertiary education institutions abroad, particularly for professional courses, is but one testament of the poor learning outcomes of our education not being commensurate to the requirements of youth today."
1218,1218,"This calls for building on our strong foundations an education system that is not only free but is of such quality that it provides the knowledge, skills and attitude to allow our people to tap their full potential and succeed."
1219,1219,Given that today the largest section of our population are youth our window of opportunity is small and therefore improving the quality of education is urgent.
1220,1220,"Of particular concern in 141 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I the outcome of education, which is highly relevant to achieving our Plan objective, is weak student performance in the foundational subjects."
1221,1221,"In all the countries that have succeeded in the economic areas we strive to develop, the competitive advantage of their education system has been a high level of performance in math and science."
1222,1222,"In our case, most students perform poorly in math and science, and have similar weaknesses even in English despite it being the medium of instruction for most subjects at all levels in school and higher education."
1223,1223,"According to Royal Education Councils (REC) research study on the quality of education, the overall trend indicates that there is a big gap between the current and the desired state in the quality of outcomes and processes."
1224,1224,"Some of the key deficiencies in the quality of learning outcomes and processes highlighted in the report include: The overall level of performance of students is just above passing grades; Graduates lack basic analytical and communication skills and the attitudes needed as entry level professions; Teaching consists of one way teacher-led chalk-and-talk without being able to get the students to comprehend and demonstrate learning; Assessment in the classroom does not close the loop between what is taught and what students learn; Low academic and professional standards for entry into teaching profession; Schools lack quality processes for developing teachers capacity, the autonomy and instructional resources to initiate academic improvement and the essential physical infrastructure to support learning; No clear link between the stated national socio-economic goals and the goals of the education system; The supporting systems for schools need a great degree of strengthening in the areas of teacher preparation, curriculum standards and resources and the incentives for quality."
1225,1225,"The report underscored three critical reasons for the persistence of ineffective classroom practices across schools: namely under-prepared teachers, lack of appropriate curricular resources, and poor instructional leadership and in- service training."
1226,1226,The study recommended a thoughtfully designed and carefully C EN TR A L PL A N 05 142 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I implemented comprehensive reform effort to bridge the gap between the current set of challenges facing our school system and the high aspirations it holds.
1227,1227,"Various other studies/reports also suggest that education infrastructure facilities alone are not sufficient to improve education outcomes but adequate, motivated and appropriately qualified teachers play a critical role in ensuring quality education."
1228,1228,"However, our education system continues to be constrained by an acute shortage of teachers and limited capacities."
1229,1229,"Teaching, today, is the least preferred profession among graduates, and attracting high performing graduates to join teaching is increasingly a major challenge."
1230,1230,"Some of the reasons for this include lack of incentives, both financial and non-financial incentives, perceived poor career progression and limitations in the recruitment process."
1231,1231,"During the Tenth Plan, initiatives to strengthen human resource policy to provide better career progression for teachers were implemented."
1232,1232,"However, the proposed teacher incentives remains unimplemented due to resource constraints."
1233,1233,The TVET and tertiary education systems are also faced with a similar set of challenges on the issue of relevance and quality of education.
1234,1234,"Furthermore, current projections indicate that about 60,000 students would be completing classes 10 and 12 and entering the labour market over the Eleventh Plan."
1235,1235,"If we are to close the education to employment gap, it is vital to ensure that the TVET and tertiary education institutes have the intake capacity to provide relevant and quality post- secondary education and training to ensure their employability."
1236,1236,"According to REC Report 2008, an independent assessment of the TVET system indicates that the content standards of programmes are not reflective of industry standards or requirements; students are inadequately trained upon graduation; the training institutes are under-resourced and faculty under-qualified; and there is a significant education to employment gap as students do not necessarily follow into the trade for which they have been trained however inadequately."
1237,1237,There is a widely shared view on the need for the TVET institutes and colleges of RUB to be consolidated along a single-campus and multi-disciplinary model if we are to ensure relevance and quality in our TVET and tertiary education system.

1243,1243,The expenditure in the education sector is expected to further increase in coming years particularly with increasing cost of maintenance of past infrastructure investments and additional capital investments to absorb the increasing enrollment pressure at various levels.
1244,1244,"In addition, with the phasing out of WFPs assistance after 2018, the government will need to take over the school feeding programme."
1245,1245,The school feeding programme has been one of the important factors contributing to the better enrollment rates.

1251,1251,This calls for a sustained systemic strategy rather than disparate interventions to address challenges in isolation.
1252,1252,The planning and implementation of such an education strategy certainly requires a longer-term perspective of more than five years.
1253,1253,The experience of top performing education systems like in Finland and Singapore suggest a gestation of at least 20 years.
1254,1254,"Most importantly, the strategy must be supported with adequate and predictable resources and the necessary institutional and policy support systems."
1255,1255,"Some of the elements of the strategy for improved outcomes of the education sector, relevant to the school, TVET and tertiary education systems, include: Clarifying goals and raising performance standards for schools through shared national education goals that are aligned with the national socio-economic goals; learning standards and quality teaching processes; Curriculum improvements to deliver educational goals with greater involvement of principals and teachers in curriculum design and communication and training on improved curriculum; Attracting the best talent into teaching by recruiting the most capable candidates into teaching and preparing them for effective classroom practice; Giving teachers the skills and tools to raise the quality of classroom instruction C EN TR A L PL A N 05 146 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I through continuous professional development and structured teaching- learning resources; Developing Principals to become Instructional Leaders through leadership training, professional support and instructional improvement processes; Enabling the capacity of schools to focus on learning and teaching through policies to promote autonomy, accountability, incentives and improving the quality of instructional tools and infrastructure facilities to support learning; Maintain relentless focus on implementation demonstrate real changes in school, manage change and build institutional capacity to execute reforms; Ensuring students grasp basic academic concepts, acquire essentials life skills and are fully equipped for college and professional life; The possible introduction of a vouchers scheme for meeting the targets for tertiary enrolment that will also encourage private participation in this sector."
1256,1256,Targeted intervention programmes: Targeted intervention programmes will be developed to address disparities.
1257,1257,"The focus will be on Dzongkhags with education indicators below the national average and hard to reach communities, children in remote areas, nomadic communities etc."
1258,1258,"Targeted programmes will include activities like additional infrastructure facilities, improved teacher deployment, special incentive packages and in certain situation where cost of service delivery is very high it could include relocation of students to nearby schools with boarding facilities."
1259,1259,"Rationalization of schools: In pursuit of improving access, past Plans focused on extensive education infrastructure expansion program resulting in 553 schools and 112 Extended Classrooms (ECRs) for about 180,000 school children."
1260,1260,"While facilitating access and enhancing enrolment, this strategy has led to other challenges."
1261,1261,The deployment of teachers continues to be a major issue due to the remote and difficult location of these extremely small schools.
1262,1262,Due to lack of economies of scale the difficulty of providing appropriate and adequate infrastructure facilities and resources results in multi-grade teaching learning situations which ultimately compromise the overall quality of education.
1263,1263,"The Eleventh Plan will focus on rationalization of schools with the objective of ensuring quality learning outcomes, with particular focus on children in remote rural schools."
1264,1264,"147 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I The Plan will also ensure sustainability of education service delivery by making efficient and effective use of available resources through the rationalization process keeping in mind the ground realities facing each Dzongkhag, Gewog and school."
1265,1265,The approach would be to downgrade unsustainable primary schools with enrolment of less than 100 students which do not have scope for future increase in enrolment to extended classrooms (ECRs).
1266,1266,"Currently, there are approximately 270 primary schools with enrolment of less than 100 children."
1267,1267,"With rationalization, all the primary schools would be developed to ensure that they are adequately and appropriately staffed and resourced, and the children have access to an appropriate and conducive teaching learning environment."
1268,1268,"Similarly, the downgraded schools or ECRs would be developed to ensure quality learning for the remaining students, and the additional teachers made available as a result of the rationalization would be redeployed by the Dzongkhag to the schools which face teacher shortage."
1269,1269,"Professional Development for Teachers: Towards enhancing teacher morale and motivation and improving the quality of the teaching profession, Teacher Human Resource Policies and the In-Service Teacher Education and Training (INSET) Masterplan have been drawn up for implementation."
1270,1270,"The Ministry of Education in collaboration with Royal Education Council will focus on promoting innovation, creativity and enterprise in education through implementation of research recommendations."
1271,1271,"Improved service delivery and private participation: To ensure sustainability, school administration and governance system will be strengthened and private participation actively pursued."
1272,1272,"Tracking school rankings, teacher outcomes and improving public service delivery will enhanced through Performance Management Systems (PMS)."
1273,1273,Private participation and schemes to encourage self-financed students particularly in tertiary education will be developed.
1274,1274,"5.1.5 Key Programmes Some of the key programmes for the Eleventh Plan: Education i) Construction of new schools based on need to increase space especially at the secondary levels; ii) Provision of minimum standard facilities, wherever required, to ensure a C EN TR A L PL A N 05 148 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I positive environment for teaching-learning process."
1275,1275,"These include facilities such as science labs, libraries, games and sports facilities, computers, ICT infrastructure, etc ; iii) Consolidation of schools through provision of additional facilities such as hostels, kitchen and store, warden/matron quarters, toilet facilities, water supply, dining hall, etc."
1276,1276,"in nearby schools and rationalizing smaller schools; iv) Provision of staff quarters/allowances especially in remote and rural areas to make rural posting attractive and improve quality of education in the remote locations; v) Addressing gender gaps at higher secondary level through provision of gender responsive facilities such as hostels and hostel toilets for girls toilets and housing for female teachers; vi) Strengthening curriculum research and development and finding mechanisms to enhance efficiency, accountability and retain specialized skills; vii) Enhance capacity of tertiary education to achieve GER at tertiary education of 35 percent by 2017-18; viii) Enhance quality and relevance of tertiary education programmes to meet the needs of individuals as well as the industry and society at large."
1277,1277,"TVET i) Improve quality of TVET/VTI infrastructure expansion, program diversification and curriculum improvement in close collaboration with the industries and private sector; and improving capacity of the instructors."
1278,1278,Programme details are presented in Eleventh Plan Volume II document.
1279,1279,"149 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 5.2 Health Sector All Bhutanese avail free health services from primary to tertiary level health care as a right guaranteed by the Constitution of Bhutan under its Principles of State Policy, Article 9, Section 21, which states that: the State shall provide free access to basic public health services in both modern and traditional medicines."
1280,1280,Health is also an important component for happiness and wellbeing.
1281,1281,"The 2010 GNH Survey reports that health domain contributed 14 percent to GNH, the highest contribution among the nine domains."
1282,1282,"While provision of health care services is the responsibility of the Health Sector, the need to involve other sectors in addressing health issues is equally important."
1283,1283,Adoption of the GNH Policy Screening Tool31 which has health as one of the variables for policy screening has facilitated in mainstreaming health.
1284,1284,"In the Eleventh Plan, the Ministry of Health shall strive towards achieving universal health coverage by focusing on providing improved and equitable access to quality health care services."
1285,1285,Continued efforts shall be made in achieving goals and targets beyond MDGs.
1286,1286,Investments will also be made in working towards fulfilling the global monitoring framework for prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
1287,1287,5.2.1 Current Situation Considerable progress has been made in developing the capacity of the health system and it has resulted in significant improvements in health outcomes.

1290,1290,The lack of progress on HIV/AIDS remains a concern.
1291,1291,Health coverage is estimated at 90 percent.
1292,1292,"Currently there are three health facilities for every 10,000 persons."
1293,1293,"There are 31 hospitals, 14 BHU I, 178 BHU II and 550 outreach clinics providing modern health services."
1294,1294,There is one Indigenous Hospital and 48 Indigenous Unit providing Sowa Rigpa services.
1295,1295,"The total manpower in the health sector is 4,280, of which 194 are doctors, 736 nurses, 1,543 other category of health workers and 1,807 administrative and support staff."
1296,1296,"The enactment of the University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) Act and its establishment in 2012, is a major initiative of the Health Sector towards providing in-country professional medical education and, thereby, addressing the critical shortage of health and allied professionals."
1297,1297,The government health sector expenditure over the last ten years has averaged Nu.
1298,1298,1.2 billion per annum with annual expenditure growth of 12.5 percent.
1299,1299,The recurrent expenditure to GDP in the Eleventh Plan is projected to be around 0.56 percent.
1300,1300,The expenditure in the health sector is expected to increase in the coming years with the introduction of new technologies and services and growing incidence of non-communicable diseases for which the associated costs are much greater than for conventional diseases.
1301,1301,The Ministry of Health has started tracking national spending and resource flow in health through the National Health Accounts and other thematic studies to ensure sustainability of healthcare financing.
1302,1302,5.2.2 Key Challenges Delivering Quality Health Care The public expectation for quality health care is viewed against the five-star private hospitals.
1303,1303,"In addition, the easy availability of un-validated information from the net with the ever increasing literate population 32National Health Accounts 2009-10 151 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I is forcing the public health system to adapt to the latest medical technologies and medical procedures."
1304,1304,Such adaptations may not necessarily be cost effective and efficient in service delivery.
1305,1305,On the other hand there are no standard health services package developed at all levels of service delivery and standard operating procedures for most of the services and procedures needs to be developed.
1306,1306,"In absence of such standards, it is very difficult or near impossible to measure the quality of health care delivery."
1307,1307,Health Human Resource: The Bhutanese Health System suffers from acute shortage of all categories of health personnel.
1308,1308,The training for most categories of health workers and especially for doctors is long and expensive.
1309,1309,In addition Bhutan does not have training institutes for most categories of health workers.
1310,1310,"Even in the region, there are few reputed health training institutes so limitation in availability of slots is a challenge."
1311,1311,Therefore we will continue to face health human resource shortage in the Eleventh Plan even as we face the need to expand health services.
1312,1312,Consolidation of health infrastructure would therefore be a strategic area of focus.
1313,1313,"With the increasing rate of urbanization, deployment of health personnel to rural areas will become a new challenge."
1314,1314,"Workload, remuneration, and many other workplace factors need to be looked beyond Civil Service norms otherwise shortage of health human resource will become a major problem."

1318,1318,"Consequently, diabetes, hypertension, cancers and traffic injuries are increasingly on the rise."
1319,1319,"Besides the profound implication on the quality of life of individuals, families and society at large, the cost of treating patients with NCDs is exorbitant."
1320,1320,"We would need to intensify our efforts on health promotion, multi-sectoral response to NCDs and ensuring health is considered as a critical component in all policies."

1329,1329,"However Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB, and HIV-TB co-infection is increasing."
1330,1330,The impact of climate change is already becoming visible with malaria cases being detected in areas that were once free of the disease.
1331,1331,"Although Bhutan is making all efforts to eliminate malaria, cross border transmission is still an issue."
1332,1332,"Dengue, chikugunya outbreaks have been reported, isolated cases of Kala-azahar are reported and Japanese Encephalitis is also suspected to have made its entry."
1333,1333,Maternal and Child Health- Tremendous progress has been made in the field of mother and child health.
1334,1334,"However, performance on certain indicators such as MMR, compared to other countries in the region and the low allocations relative to health spending is still a cause of concern."
1335,1335,Nearly two-fifth of deliveries are still attended by medically untrained personnel increasing the risk of maternal and neonatal death.
1336,1336,Infant death and especially neonatal death are among the highest death occurring within the health facilities.
1337,1337,There is a need to invest heavily in this area.
1338,1338,Nutrition The general nutritional status of the people has been improving over the decade.
1339,1339,"While malnutrition indicators like underweight prevalence and wasting have improved, stunting prevalence of 33.5 percent still remains as a major public health issue."
1340,1340,"In addition, anemia prevalence in women and children are quite alarming with 54.8 percent and 80.6 percent respectively."
1341,1341,"Bhutan has also been C EN TR A L PL A N 05 154 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I experiencing sporadic outbreaks of vitamin deficiencies, particularly Vitamin B1 and B12 since 1998, and occurrences have been recorded almost every year."
1342,1342,"There is a need to put in coordinated efforts among Health, Agriculture and Education and Economic Sectors to improve the nutritional status."
1343,1343,Sustainable Healthcare Financing: The constitution mandates the state to provide free health care ensuring the global commitment to universal health coverage is achieved.
1344,1344,Currently the government budget outlay for health is around 6 percent and total health expenditure as percent of GDP is 3.6 percent.
1345,1345,Global health experts recommend for a country like Bhutan allocation of around 5 percent of the GDP and about 8 percent of the total government budget on health to ensure that quality health care services are provided.
1346,1346,The Bhutan Health Trust Fund is one innovative mechanism set up by the government with support of its partners to ensure sustainable supply of essential drugs.
1347,1347,The endowment fund of the BHTF stands at around USD 24 million.
1348,1348,There is also a need to promote good governance so that wastage is minimized and cost efficient and effective health services are promoted.

1352,1352,"The centre shall focus more on policy directions, service standard development, quality assurance, selection of appropriate medical technologies and procedures, ensuring un-interrupted medical supplies and health personnel recruitment."
1353,1353,The Ministry will continue to focus on improving access and delivery of quality health care services by strengthening both institutional and human capacity with emphasis on decentralization.
1354,1354,The Health Sector will continue to explore areas which can be decentralized to the districts.
1355,1355,"Capacities to improve efficiency in management, coordination and planning including resource mobilization shall be pursued to strengthen the initiative of decentralized approach."
1356,1356,"In line with the commitment to work towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the package of Health services to be delivered at every level of health facilities shall be standardized and expansion of services will be explored on need basis."

1358,1358,"Emphasis will be continued to strengthen preventive and health promotion, through intensifying awareness programmes, enhancing cross- sectoral coordination, and advocating for health in all policies to address public health challenges such as, but not limiting to NCDs, injuries, HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, Maternal and Child Health, Nutrition and Neglected tropical Diseases."
1359,1359,Health human resources development Development of health human resource in line with the Health HRD Master Plan shall be accelerated.
1360,1360,Effective planning and efficient deployment of health personnel to improve service delivery will be pursued.
1361,1361,"The deployment of health personnel to hospitals, BHUs and ORCs will be need-based depending on number of patients attended by these health centres."
1362,1362,Sustainable Health Financing There is a global push to go for achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
1363,1363,"For a developing country like Bhutan, in order to achieve UHC, almost 5 percent of the GDP and 8 percent of the total government budget needs to be allocated to health sector."
1364,1364,"In addition, measures such as enhancing effectiveness and improving efficiency, and other alternative options to maintain constitutional commitment to provide free health care services and also to achieve UHC will be explored."
1365,1365,"157 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Standardization of eHealth and interoperability Recognizing that lack of data within and between systems hinders care and leads to fragmentation of the health information system, it is vital to develop measures for effective and timely transmission of data."
1366,1366,The development of an integrated health information system shall be centralized to ensure the eHealth standardization and interoperability of the system.
1367,1367,Interoperability is essential in garnering full potential of ICT and medical devices towards supporting health system development.
1368,1368,"Needs assessment for eHealth, inclusive of developing national policies, strategies, norms and appropriate governance mechanisms, and long term strategic plans or frameworks for eHealth, shall be conducted."

1371,1371,"Consolidation of health infrastructure The production of health human resource has not kept pace with the expansion of health infrastructure and, therefore, there is a huge mismatch between the health human resources and the number of health infrastructure, affecting the quality of health services."
1372,1372,"Also, some of the existing facilities are underutilized while others over burdened."
1373,1373,"Hence, rationalization of health infrastructure through use of health facility screening tool and consolidation of health infrastructure will be pursued."

1388,1388,"The high priority given to human resource development through investments in education, implementation of long and short-term trainings both in-country and ex-country and the various reforms in human resource management, particularly in the civil services, has to a great extent improved human resource situation."
1389,1389,"However, the quality of human resources particularly in professional and high skilled areas continues to be a constraining factor, both in the public and private sector."
1390,1390,"As a result, dependency on foreign workers continues to be high."
1391,1391,The Eleventh Plan focus will be on creating a highly skilled and well qualified talent pool.
1392,1392,"The main agencies responsible for HRD include the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources, Royal University of Bhutan and the Royal Civil Service Commission."
1393,1393,"5.3.1 Current Situation Due to small and nascent private sector, most job seekers prefer jobs in the civil service for better job security, career advancement and training & educational opportunities."

1402,1402,The current human resource development strategy also lacks synergy between the education system and manpower needs leading to mismatch of aspirations of the job seekers and jobs available.
1403,1403,"On one hand, we continue to be dependent on expatriates, international volunteers and foreign skilled manpower while on the other hand unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, remains high."
1404,1404,"Some of the sectors, particularly health, education, construction, ICT and aviation continue to depend on expatriates and volunteers to fill in the gap."
1405,1405,"Further, retention of the civil servants is becoming a challenge."
1406,1406,"Increasingly, many teachers, engineers, doctors and technical professionals are leaving the civil service to join international organizations, corporations, and projects offering better remuneration and service benefits."
1407,1407,"For instance, in the education sector, where there is already an acute shortage of teachers, the teacher turnover is high at about 4 percent annually."
1408,1408,"Therefore, addressing human resource management issues need urgent attention to enhance performance, efficiency and motivation among the civil servants."

1486,1486,41BMIS 2010 172 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 5.5.2 Key Challenges Loss of agriculture land and declining productivity Achieving food self- sufficiency would largely depend on area under food grain cultivation and yield per hectare.
1487,1487,Rapid development and urbanization has put a lot of pressure on agriculture land.
1488,1488,This is likely to increase in the near future with increased development activities unless effective measures are put in place to protect prime agricultural lands.
1489,1489,Studies also indicate that yield per hectare has been on the decline at a compounded annual rate of 1.84 percent over the last 27 years.
1490,1490,"This could be attributed to various factors such as declining investment in the agriculture sector, loss of prime agriculture land to other use, climate change, land being kept fallow due to shortage of farm labour/irrigation, loss of crop to wildlife and limited scope of mechanization."
1491,1491,"Unless these issues are addressed in the Eleventh Plan, achieving food self-sufficiency goal in the Eleventh Plan will still remain a challenge."
1492,1492,Agriculture Environment and Challenges - Agriculture farming is characterized by steep geographic terrain.
1493,1493,"With the exception of few wide valleys in the western, central and some plains in the southern part of the country, in most part agricultural lands are located on the slopes."
1494,1494,Assessment indicates that 31 percent of the agriculture land is located on slopes more than 50 degrees.
1495,1495,"This is also one of the reason why soil erosion rate is high, estimated at 8.6 tonnes/ha or approximately 3.5 t/acres (DOA, 2011)."
1496,1496,"Moreover, despite having an abundance of water resources, agriculture is still dominated by the rain-fed dry land farming and wetland cultivation."
1497,1497,"Of the 77,493 acres of chuzhing only 59,243 acres are serviced with improved irrigation system."
1498,1498,Dry land irrigation for other crops is virtually non-existent.
1499,1499,"Further, pest and diseases continue to be a problem for the farming communities."
1500,1500,"Feral vertebrate pests such as wild boar and deer, apes such as monkey and marsupial like porcupine are major problem."
1501,1501,It is estimated that 126 kgs of crops per household are lost annually to wild animals pests.
1502,1502,"Other crop diseases such as Gray Leaf Spot and Turcicum Leaf Blight in maize, Greening in Citrus, phythoptra diseases in chilli and potatoes also continue to pose major challenges."
1503,1503,"173 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I Domestic cattle and equine population left stray in winter is one of leading factor discouraging farmers from growing winter and spring crops such as wheat, barley and buckwheat affecting the cropping intensity and overall production potential."
1504,1504,Labor shortage including increasing feminization of the agricultural labour force is becoming one of the leading constraints in agriculture production.
1505,1505,"According to agriculture statistics 2011, available farm labour constitutes only 26 percent."
1506,1506,Rural female population is more by 3.7 percent overall.
1507,1507,"In the age group of 15-64 which is also an active population group, female population is higher by 7.5 percent, and this is likely to increase."
1508,1508,This gender imbalance in agriculture workforce will also have significant impact on agriculture.
1509,1509,These factors have contributed to RNR sector providing the least monthly earnings among all major occupations.
1510,1510,"If this trend continues, it is likely that more and more people could leave their farms which could adversely impact the goals of achieving food and nutrition security, reducing unemployment levels and, may likely reverse the gains achieved in poverty reduction."

1524,1524,Transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture: Investment in the RNR sector will be aimed at ensuring gradual transition from subsistence to commercial production.
1525,1525,"This would require introduction and application of technologies that improves productivity of crop, forest and livestock."
1526,1526,"To provide both economies of scale and fair terms of trade, the evolving farmers organizations and cooperatives will be supported technically and financially, notably through preferential access to loans from financial institutions, extension support services and other forms of support."
1527,1527,Enabling environment: A policy and legal framework that incentivizes RNR production and promotes private sector investment will be implemented.
1528,1528,Access to finance will be facilitated through priority lending by financial institution to the RNR sector.
1529,1529,"Infrastructure facilities such as irrigation, storage and communication to facilitate efficient and effective production, marketing and distribution of RNR products will be prioritized."
1530,1530,Linkages between research and extension services will be strengthened and streamlined to improve the productivity of farming systems.
1531,1531,"Promote private sector participation and contract farming: Government will facilitate an enabling environment for private sector participation and contract farming to enhance market access, innovations and technical expertise."
1532,1532,"Private sector participation will be encouraged in the entire value-chain, starting from agriculture input supply to production, processing, distribution and marketing."

1536,1536,C EN TR A L PL A N 05 176 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 5.6 Tourism Sector Tourism in Bhutan is governed by the policy of high value-low impact tourism.
1537,1537,The policy serves to develop tourism that has minimum negative impact on our natural and cultural heritage.
1538,1538,The tourism pricing of USD $200 per person per night during off-seasons and USD $250 per person per night during seasons forms the basis for regulating tourist arrivals.
1539,1539,Travel to Bhutan is booked either through Bhutanese tour operator or their international partners.
1540,1540,Culture and nature are the two leading purposes for tourist arrivals.
1541,1541,The majority of arrivals are in spring (February-April) and autumn (August-October) season.
1542,1542,The tourism sector is the major source of foreign exchange earnings and employment.
1543,1543,"Out of USD 62.80 million, USD 16.63 million was generated as direct revenue for the Government through the Royalty (35 percent tourism levy on daily tariff)."
1544,1544,"Other taxes such as the Business Income Tax (BIT) and Sales Taxes paid by tourism service providers also translate into government revenue, therefore increasing revenue generated by the tourism industry."
1545,1545,"The figure includes 54,685 international visitors and 50,722 regional visitors."
1546,1546,The average length of stay was 6.90 days.
1547,1547,"The arrival figures include about 57 percent international visitors, 26 percent regional high-end visitors, 16 percent MICE (Meeting, Incentive, Conferences, Exhibition) visitors, and 1 percent familiarization visitors."
1548,1548,"The highest number of visitors was from Japan at 15.98 percent, followed by USA at 13.67 percent and China at 8.57 percent."
1549,1549,"Among the regional tourist, arrivals from India topped the list with 87 percent, followed by Bangladesh at 11 percent and Maldives at 2 percent."
1550,1550,"In terms of the tourism spread, Paro Dzongkhag hosted the maximum bed nights (32.69 percent) followed by Thimphu, Wangduephodrang, Punakha and Bumthang."
1551,1551,"Pemagatshel, Zhemgang, Tsirang, Dagana, Sarpang and Samtse were among the Dzongkhags that hosted less than 0.04 percent bed nights."
1552,1552,This is due to lack of tourism products in these Dzongkhags.
1553,1553,However this is likely to change in 177 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I the coming years with the Royal Manas National Park being open to tourism.
1554,1554,The tourist arrivals in Trashigang and Samdrup Jongkhar have improved significantly as a result of opening of Merak Sakteng trek and also use of Samdrup Jongkhar as an entry point from the south-east.
1555,1555,"The tourism package covers the cost of accommodation in a 3-Star and above category hotel, local guide and transportation, and three meals."
1556,1556,"Currently, there are 123 accommodation providers with a capacity of 2,749 rooms offering 5,464 bed nights consisting of 8 5-Star, 7 4-Star, 40 3-Star, 54 2-Star and 19 1-Star category."
1557,1557,Accommodation classified as 2-Star and below have been encouraged to upgrade to 3-Star and above in order to cater to tourist.
1558,1558,The annual occupancy rates was highest in the 3-Star category with 34.46 percent followed by 5-Star.
1559,1559,"In terms of tour operators, there were 741 registered local tour operators, of which 318 were operational."
1560,1560,"The top 12 tour operators accounted for 41.46 percent of total arrivals with the highest number of tourists managed by a single operator of 4,159 visitors."
1561,1561,"5.6.2 Key Challenges It is evident from the above that the tourism sector has made much progress and is one of the key economic sectors contributing to economic growth, employment and revenues."
1562,1562,"However, constraints in terms of accessibility, regional spread, seasonality and product diversification are still issues of concern."
1563,1563,"With just one international airport at Paro and with only Druk Air, the national carrier with a fleet of three Airbus A319 and one ATR 42-500, flying to limited destinations in the region, traveling to Bhutan is a challenge to many visitors."
1564,1564,The number of visitors to Bhutan currently is determined by Druk Airs capacity.
1565,1565,"In 2012, about 88 percent of the visitors used air as preferred mode of travel to Bhutan."
1566,1566,"The other major challenge faced is the shortage of manpower in the form of trained guides, skilled workers in hospitality sector, qualified and experienced professionals in product development, destination marketing and other tourism-related services."
1567,1567,The sector is still largely dependent on international tour operators for arrivals.
1568,1568,"Among the 20 Dzongkhags, Paro, Thimphu, Punakha, Wangduephodrang and Bumthang are the major beneficiaries of tourism."
1569,1569,"Lack of tourist infrastructure C EN TR A L PL A N 05 178 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I facilities/amenities, travel time and limited tourism products are some of the reasons for other Dzongkhags not benefitting much from the sector."
1570,1570,"However, with the completion of three domestic airports and efforts already underway to create infrastructure facilities and products in Central, South and East, the lack of regional spread is expected to be addressed in the next few years."

1646,1646,Mining - Bhutan has pursued mining activities cautiously bearing in mind the social and environmental consequences.
1647,1647,"The sector is, therefore, still underdeveloped."
1648,1648,"Although Bhutan has significant deposits of a number of mineral resources, including limestone, coal, graphite, gypsum, slate and dolomite, most mining activities are limited to relatively small operations and mainly involve the above minerals."
1649,1649,The total mineral production ranges from 5000 metric tons to over C EN TR A L PL A N 05 184 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I a million metric tons annually.
1650,1650,All the mines in the country are operated using opencast mining technique and the current land coverage by mining activities is 0.033 percent of the total area of the country.
1651,1651,"About 15,000 square kilometer from the total geographical area of 38,394 square kilometer has been geologically mapped in the scale of scale of 1:50,000 systemically."
1652,1652,There are currently about 55 registered firms in the mining sector.
1653,1653,Mining is important source of revenues.
1654,1654,"During the period 2005 to 2011, revenues from mining sector ranged from Nu."
1655,1655,"233 million annually, excluding business/corporate/personal income taxes paid by the promoters of the mines."
1656,1656,The mineral production and their uses over the last three years are as follows.
1657,1657,Table 5.7.3 Mineral Productions Further development of mining sector will be pursued considering the environmental and social impacts and intergenerational equity.
1658,1658,5.7.2 Key Challenges Foreign trade Foreign trade is dominated by a few products.
1659,1659,"In 2011, about 80 percent of Bhutans total export amounting to Nu."
1660,1660,"31,485 million comprised of electricity (Nu."

1663,1663,"10,476 million - steel bars, ingots and copper wire)."
1664,1664,The export earnings from these products are highly vulnerable with the production of electricity highly dependent on hydrological flows and the uninterrupted operation of the hydro power plants and mineral and base metals products being currently competitive only due to cheap electricity rather than any technological advantage.
1665,1665,"Further, due to high import content of raw materials for these products, they account for the highest share of the import bill."
1666,1666,The import bills for base metal and mineral products in 2011 were Nu.
1667,1667,"10,805 million respectively."
1668,1668,"The next major export product is agriculture products (mandarin, potatoes, apples, cordyceps and agro products) which accounted for about 5 percent of the total exports."
1669,1669,Bhutan faces major challenge in product diversification.
1670,1670,Continued emphasis on mineral products and base metals for export promotion could mean compromising on environmental concerns and having to continue to provide electricity to these industries at prices lower than export prices.
1671,1671,Diversification of our exports in agricultural and non- mineral and non-metal products will however require substantial investments.
1672,1672,Ease of Doing Business - In the 2012 IFC/World Bank Report on Ease of Doing Business Bhutan ranked 142 out of 183 countries.
1673,1673,"The areas requiring improvements were resolving insolvency, protecting investors, getting electricity and dealing with construction permits amongst others."

1676,1676,"While development of such industries C EN TR A L PL A N 05 186 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I are important in view of Bhutans desire to develop clean green manufacturing industries with high potential for employment and for promoting broad based inclusive growth, they are constrained by lack of access to capital, technology, markets and labour resulting in low volume, high cost and inferior quality products."
1677,1677,"Mining - In the absence of a clear mineral development policy, the management, allocation and monitoring of mining sector has been difficult."
1678,1678,The sector also faces human resource constraints both in the government and the private mining sector which has hampered effective functioning of the sector.
1679,1679,"The draft Mineral Development Policy has been prepared to address these issues, and is expected to be approved within the first year of the Eleventh Plan."

1702,1702,"The Government, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, C EN TR A L PL A N 05 188 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I will identify 4-5 non-hydro priority sectors for end-to-end intervention in the Eleventh Plan."
1703,1703,"The selection of priority sectors will be based on three filters of i) employment generation, ii) revenues to the government, and iii) returns to the entrepreneurs."
1704,1704,"Tentatively, the sectors identified are tourism (to achieve higher yields per tourist as well as double the arrivals but spread throughout the country and throughout the calendar year), agro-processing (selected produce with high potential), construction (enhance the capacity of Bhutanese contractors to deliver quality and take on more complex projects), small and cottage industries (including cultural industries such as textiles, arts and crafts) and manufacturing (explore establishment of few large scale hydro-power intensive industries)."
1705,1705,"A detailed blue print of interventions will be developed with clear initiatives, time line, targets, resource requirements and persons responsible to deliver the initiatives."
1706,1706,The implementation of the programme will be rigorously monitored by the Cabinet and Committee of Secretaries and problem solving sessions facilitated to expedited smooth implementation of the programme.
1707,1707,"To facilitate private sector development, the government will facilitate the development of economic infrastructure such as industrial estates in Jigmeling in Gelephu, Dhamdum in Samtse, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar and Bondeyma in Mongar and establishment of dry ports in Phuentsholing."
1708,1708,"The government will also review and address issues related to excise refund, access to finance particularly for cottage, small and medium industries, reduction in turn-around-time for Government to Business (G2B) services specially in terms of government clearances/ approvals, and development of capital markets."
1709,1709,5.7.5 Key Programmes Some of the key programmes include: Export Promotion and Market Access: The programme aims to strategically enhance our export capacity and leverage our comparative advantages to build our competitiveness in the international market through export promotion and marketing and facilitation of exports through integration into the regional and international trading environment.
1710,1710,"Strengthening Trade Policy and Regulatory Framework: The emphasis will be on strengthening the policy and regulatory framework to improve and simplify the procedures for business start-ups, prevent business malpractices, promote 189 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I fair competition in the market and promote international best practices in the business environment."
1711,1711,The drafting of the Consumers Protection Act and enactment of the Trade Development Act and the Competition Policy/Act are key policy and regulatory instruments that will be pursued.
1712,1712,"Further, the Dechencholing fuel depot will be relocated to Thinchupangkha under Paro Dzongkhag and Fuel quality will be upgraded to Euro IV."
1713,1713,Promotion of sustainable and environment friendly industrial development - The focus will be on development of industrial parks to promote private sector development and enhance socio-economic activity in a particular region.
1714,1714,"In order to promote balanced regional development and enhance rural economy, four Industrial Parks will be developed and established at Bondeyma in Mongar, Dhandhum in Samtse, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar and Jigmeling in Sarpang."

1746,1746,"High voltage (HV) consumers or factories in West Bengal pay Rs 6.13 a unit, while in Assam it is Rs 4.18 a unit A new element in the revised electricity tariff is that rural consumers are provided free electricity for first 100 units for the next three years."
1747,1747,This was done to encourage the rural community to use electricity to cut down use of firewood for environmental and health reasons.
1748,1748,Table 5.8.2 Revised Electricity Tariff 45Kuensel 15 October 2013 193 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 5.8.2 Key Challenges The high upfront investment costs required for developing hydro-power projects pose significant challenge in terms of raising financing for the project.
1749,1749,The pace of hydropower project development will however depend on the availability of financing.
1750,1750,The extensive rural electrification programme to supply electricity to all households through grid and non-grid supply carried out since the Sixth Plan has resulted in substantial increase in number of domestic consumers and the demand for electricity.
1751,1751,"Maintaining the balance between the needs of domestic consumption and export earnings, meeting the demand by households and industries, and the cost of electricity supply and viability of tariff levels will be a challenge till new hydropower projects are commissioned."
1752,1752,"Other challenges that need to be addressed include infrastructure development, system reinforcement and human resource capacity."
1753,1753,"Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) Bhutan is home to 677 glaciers and 2,674 glacial lakes (Second National Communication, 2011)."
1754,1754,The report indicates that the two lakes are about 30 meters apart separated by a shrinking moraine dam.
1755,1755,If the barrier is broken the water body from Thorthormi would flow into Raphstreng creating the threat of a possible outburst flood.
1756,1756,The combined volume of water from these two lakes are projected to produce about 53 million cubic metres which would cause a flood three times more powerful than the 1994 flood in Punakha from Luggye lake.

1941,1941,It is also a key sector in terms of its contribution to economic growth and employment.
1942,1942,The key agencies responsible for the development of construction sector are: Department of Engineering Services (DES): DES was created in 2011 by bifurcating the erstwhile Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES) into Department of Engineering Services (DES) and Department of Human Settlement (DHS).
1943,1943,"DES is responsible for promoting construction technology, providing technical backstopping to the other ministries, Dzongkhag Administrations and Thromdes and supporting professional development of all the engineers."
1944,1944,Construction Development Board (CDB): CDB is a bridge between the government and the construction industry and is responsible for facilitating development of a vibrant construction industry.
1945,1945,"Its core functions include registration, classification and monitoring of contractors, consultants and engineers/architects."
1946,1946,"Construction Development Corporation Limited (CDCL): CDCL was established on 1st July 2006 as a public sector company owned by the Royal Government of Bhutan with the following objectives: Enhance efficiency, mechanization, improve standards and create a good benchmark of quality infrastructure in the construction sector."
1947,1947,"Lead the modernization of the construction industry through the introduction of appropriate machineries and technologies, including the maintenance of an equipment bank of machines not easily available in the market to support the government and the private sector."
1948,1948,"Participate in the booming construction industry, introducing technology intensive construction and building capacity of local construction industry through collaborations."
1949,1949,"Generate employment and at the same time develop necessary skills for skilled and unskilled national manpower, thereby gradually reducing dependence on the expatriate work force."
1950,1950,The private sector is represented by the Construction Association of Bhutan under the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI).
1951,1951,Its membership includes all firms under the construction industry.
1952,1952,213 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I The sector has come a long way with establishment of various agencies and introduction of many new initiatives towards making the sector more efficient and effective.
1953,1953,"However, poor quality of construction, human resource constraints and high construction costs continue to affect the sector."
1954,1954,"The main thrust in the Eleventh Plan will, therefore, be on enhancing the quality of construction through efficient and appropriate technology, mechanization and human resource development."

1999,1999,"The Bhutan National Urbanization Strategy 2008 estimates that the average annual growth of urban population in Bhutan during 2000-2005 was 7.3 percent, with Thimphu city experiencing the highest growth at 12.6 percent."
2000,2000,"This rapid growth in urban population has created severe pressure on existing facilities leading to problems of water shortages, lack of sanitation and waste disposal facilities etc."
2001,2001,"To address these problems, a number of urban development programmes, particularly in Thimphu and Phuentsholing, have been implemented over the last decade."
2002,2002,"However, in spite of major infrastructure expansion, the rural-urban migration trend continues and urban centres continue to face difficulties in provision of urban services."
2003,2003,"Further, expansion of the existing services is also constrained by limited land availability in urban areas."

2042,2042,The challenge is not only in terms of increasing the housing stock but also making it affordable particularly for the low and middle income group.
2043,2043,The high cost of financing and raw materials makes construction expensive resulting in higher rents.

2215,2215,"Water Quality of Wangchhu, Thimphu."
2216,2216,The river was investigated at three different stretches for water quality assessment viz.
2217,2217,"Cheri, Babesa, and Khasadrapchhu, considering physical, chemical, microbiological and biological characteristics of the river."
2218,2218,"Results revealed Wangchhu at Babesa highly contaminated, that measured 428 CFU/100 ml faecal coliforms, whereas at Khasadrapchu it showed indication of recovery measuring 46CFU/100 ml water."
2219,2219,"Maximum permissible standard limit of faecal coliforms as recommended for Bhutan at final effluent from a sewerage treatment plant (STP) is 1,000 MPN/100 ml water."
2220,2220,"At Cheri, the river was free from faecal coliforms."
2221,2221,"A team also applied a bio-monitoring tool in the water quality assessment, which includes rapid field assessment of the quality of river considering bottom dwelling larvae of insects which are considered highly sensitive to the increase in pollution."
2222,2222,"Results revealed no pollution (water quality class I) in Cheri, critical to heavy pollution (III/IV) in Babesa, and critical to moderate pollution (III/II) in Khasadrapchhu."
2223,2223,"This problem is exacerbated in the urban centers where surface drainage, grey water sullage from domestic households and uncontrolled seepage or overflow from septic tanks and pipes enter into the watercourses."
2224,2224,C EN TR A L PL A N 05 238 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 5.17.2 Key Challenges Environmental conservation is becoming increasingly challenging as we open up to meet the development needs of a growing population.
2225,2225,"The key environmental challenges that the country faces relate to the nexus of environmental degradation, poverty and economic growth."
2226,2226,"Population growth, increasing demand of natural resources, inappropriate technology and consumption choices, and pressures of development are the drivers of environmental degradation."
2227,2227,"The ambient air and water quality, in general, still ranges from good to excellent but there are some pockets of urban and industrial areas where air and water quality is deteriorating due to vehicular and industrial pollution, construction activities, and unsanitary waste disposal."
2228,2228,It is also increasingly evident that poor environmental quality has adversely affected human health.
2229,2229,"The environmental problems such as lack of access to adequate clean water, clean air and energy are closely linked to poverty."
2230,2230,"Interventions such as reducing indoor air pollution, protecting sources of safe drinking water, protecting soil from contamination, improved sanitation measures, and better public health governance, offer tremendous opportunities for reducing the incidence of a number of critical health problems."
2231,2231,Although the Government has enacted Waste Prevention and Management Act in 2009 yet there are challenges in terms of proper waste management.
2232,2232,"While there are some good practices being carried out on a pilot basis, lack of proper waste management, indiscriminate littering, open dumping of solid waste are some of the challenges faced which eventually pollutes natural environment posing serious hazards to public health."
2233,2233,"While the waste regulation is being revised, education, awareness and advocacy programmes are very critical for proper waste management."
2234,2234,"With the ever increasing development activities and industries, a challenge to the environment and planning sector is the cumulative effect of the combined activities on the ecosystem within a given space."
2235,2235,The challenge of the task lies in the lack of capacity within the National Environment Commission to undertake such a huge activity.
2236,2236,"Another major set of challenges arises from emerging global environmental concerns such as climate change, global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss."
2237,2237,The key is to operationalize the principle of common but differentiated responsibility of countries in relation to these problems.
2238,2238,"At the same time, multilateral regimes and programmes responding to these global 239 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I environmental issues must not adversely impact the development opportunities of developing countries."
2239,2239,The major challenge faced by the sector in implementation of the legislation pertains to lack of human resources and capacity.
2240,2240,Water Security - Water is an important natural resource for basic survival of all living beings.
2241,2241,"It is also a vital resource for our agriculture, hydropower projects and industries."
2242,2242,"C EN TR A L PL A N 05 62Bhutan Environment Outlook, 2008, NEC, RGoB."
2243,2243,"240 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I While at macro level the per capita water availability is high, at local levels access to water is a serious concern with several places facing water shortages."
2244,2244,"Till recently, surface water was the main source for drinking water but some towns like Thimphu, Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar have now resorted to exploring ground water due to acute water shortages."
2245,2245,"Similarly, despite abundance of water resources at macro level, arable land is largely dependent on rains."

2283,2283,"Further, the Parliament passed the Local Government Act 2009, which translated the important constitutional principle of decentralized governance into law and mandated the formation of local governments for the development, management and administration of areas under their jurisdiction."
2284,2284,"Also, the government has initiated number of proactive measures to further strengthen the process of decentralization, including the introduction of Gewog Based Planning process in the Ninth Plan and the rationalized formula based annual grants system for all local government from the Tenth Plan."
2285,2285,The formula for local government annual grants was reviewed and revised64 and the Eleventh Plan resource envelop to the local governments are based on the revised resource allocation formula.

2302,2302,One area Bhutan scores low is the political participation.
2303,2303,"The concern with this is if the citizens stop participating in the political process, for example not voting, then that system loses legitimacy since it is hard for it to claim that it has a political mandate of the majority of the people."
2304,2304,"Therefore, education and awareness and enhancing participation particularly of youth, women and disadvantaged groups are vital."
2305,2305,"To strengthen the process of decentralization, administrative and fiscal devolution of authority alone is not sufficient but of equal importance is to build the capacity of those at the grassroots to plan, implement and monitor development activities."

2325,2325,"The allocation of annual grants to local governments based on the resource allocation formula that took into account principles of equity, transparency and objectivity was launched."
2326,2326,The new system of allocating resources to the local governments provided greater predictability and offered higher flexibility in prioritization and programming of activities.
2327,2327,"The devolution of authority has enhanced capacities of the local governments in planning, prioritization and fiscal management."
2328,2328,"The division of responsibilities framework70, clearly delineates responsibilities among the central agencies, Class A Thromde, Dzongkhags and Gewogs guided by the principle of subsidiarity."
2329,2329,The principle of subsidiarity is that provision of public goods and services should take place at the lowest level of the government and that the centre should be involved only when the lower levels of the government cannot provide the goods and services efficiently.
2330,2330,The division of responsibility framework will be reviewed during the Eleventh Plan mainly to assess the capacity of the local governments to shoulder increased responsibilities and to build their capacities accordingly.
2331,2331,"In addition to the broad based socio-economic development activities, targeted poverty intervention programmes such as the Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) and the National Rehabilitation Programme (NRP) were initiated in the Tenth Plan to accelerate poverty reduction and address disparities at the local level."

2336,2336,Efforts are also underway to identify other communities for rehabilitation given that this programme benefits not only the beneficiary communities but also the government through avoidance of the higher costs associated with provision of pubic goods and services for reaching the unreached.
2337,2337,"6.1.1 Planning Process The local government plans were formulated based on the Local Government Act 2009, the Eleventh Plan preparation guidelines, the Local Development Planning Manual, the Thromde Structural Plans, the Local Area Plans (LAPs) and the indicative five year resource envelope."
2338,2338,The process involved close consultations with the communities in order to take stock of the ground realities and assess their needs and aspirations.
2339,2339,"These were further deliberated and discussed at the Gewog Tshogdes, Dzongkhag Tshogdus, and Thromde Tshogdus before being finalized and approved."
2340,2340,The draft LG Eleventh Plan was then submitted to the GNHC for further discussion and coordination at the national level.
2341,2341,"While sectoral activities at the local level, as per the division of responsibility framework, are prioritized and planned by the local governments, the planning for education activities is centrally coordinated by the Ministry of Education."

2346,2346,The formula based resource allocation does not apply to class A Thromdes.
2347,2347,"The resource allocation to class A Thromde are need based due to the diversity and complexity of these Thromdes in terms of social, economic and environmental issues."

2429,2429,"The Dzongkhag also has potential for enhancing cash crop, non-wood forest products and floriculture production if issues of human wildlife conflict, farm labour shortages, irrigation and storage and marketing facilities are addressed."
2430,2430,"Further, the establishment of a mini dry-port in Phuentsholing, construction of Raidak-Lamoizingkha and Manitar-Raidak roads, an international standard football ground and three new mega hydroelectricity projects viz."
2431,2431,"180 MW Bunakha Hydroelectric project, 540 MW Ammochhu Hydroelectric project, and 570 MW Wangchu Hydroelectric project are planned for implementation in the Eleventh Plan."
2432,2432,These activities provide opportunities for employment generation and further boosting of trade and commerce in the Dzongkhag.
2433,2433,"In terms of the challenges, while the overall poverty rates are just below the national average, there are villages within the Dzongkhag where poverty is high LO C A L G O VE R N M EN T PL A N S 06 270 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I and people lack the basic socio-economic facilities due to remoteness and difficult terrain."
2434,2434,Addressing these pockets of rural poverty will be a challenge.

2436,2436,"6.2.2.3 Strategies In keeping with the Plan objective of Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio- economic Development, the key strategies of the Dzongkhag will be on i) enhancing agricultural and livestock productivity, and ii) targeted poverty reduction programmes."
2437,2437,"The majority of the rural population in the Dzongkhag depends on agriculture, livestock and horticulture for their livelihood."
2438,2438,"Therefore, the Dzongkhag will focus on enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity which will not only contribute towards enhancing household incomes and employment generation but will also contribute towards import substitution of agricultural and livestock products."
2439,2439,"The Dzongkhag has potential to enhance agricultural production of mandarin, cardamom, potatoes and a variety of vegetables, besides possessing a rich reserve of non-wood forest resources such as medicinal plants, edible wild vegetable and roots."
2440,2440,"Hence efforts will focus on development of rural infrastructure, commercialization, farm mechanization, better herd management and use of improved breeds of cattle, addressing human wildlife conflict and development of small and medium enterprises through formation of famers groups/cooperatives."

2513,2513,"This is mainly because the delivery of health and education services is a challenge due to difficult terrain, harsh climatic conditions and remoteness."
2514,2514,Addressing health and education issues remain a priority.
2515,2515,6.2.4.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges The key opportunities are in the area of livestock and NWFP production.
2516,2516,"Gasa Dzongkhag produced about 20 MT of butter, 37 MT of cheese and 23 MT of chugo in 2011 (RNR Statistics, MoA, 2012)."
2517,2517,"The Dzongkhag recorded highest collection of cordyceps in 2010 with 26 percent (141.7 kgs) of the total 541.9 Kgs collected (DAMC, MoA, 2010)."

2521,2521,"The number of foreign tourists visiting the Dzongkhag is increasing where it recorded 409 visitors in 2011 (NSB, 2012)."
2522,2522,The lack of access to health and education facilities and services is a major challenge faced by the Dzongkhag.
2523,2523,"The difficult terrain, harsh climatic conditions and remoteness makes it difficult to provide these facilities."
2524,2524,"Some of the problems are lack of private service providers and contractors, less time for development and transportation due to snowfall in winter in the northern regions of the Dzongkhag."
2525,2525,The primary school completion rate is also lowest in the country with only 41.3 percent (89)74 of children completing primary education.
2526,2526,Access to education is provided by four schools.

2535,2535,This is primarily due to poor health and education outcomes in the Dzongkhag.
2536,2536,"Therefore, one key strategy will be to improve health and education outcomes."
2537,2537,"The Dzongkhag in close cooperation with the Ministries of Health and Education and other relevant central agencies will ensure that necessary infrastructure facilities and other resources such as equipment, drugs and vaccines and adequate/qualified personnel are made available to improve delivery of health and education services."

2545,2545,"Further, as majority of the households depend on non-wood forest products such as cordyceps and medicinal plants for income, which accounts for almost 60 percent of their total income."
2546,2546,"Therefore to ensure sustainable livelihood from non-wood forest products, the Dzongkhag will ensure sustainable management of forest and forestry products through implementation of activities such as community and private forestry establishment, afforestation and reforestation programme, watershed management and conservation."
2547,2547,"While Gasa enjoys the highest levels of household income compared to the rest of the Dzongkhags, there are villages within the Dzongkhag where poverty levels are high."
2548,2548,"Therefore, to address these disparities, five villages namely Amochhu, Remi, Wachey, Yesona and Zomena will be supported through REAP Phase II, one of the targeted poverty reduction programmes."
2549,2549,"Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-help groups/ cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households within the village."

2907,2907,The high level of poverty is attributed to low levels of literacy in the Dzongkhag.
2908,2908,"The general literacy was 49.8 percent against national average of 63 percent, second lowest in the country, youth literacy was 70.6 percent compared to national LO C A L G O VE R N M EN T PL A N S 06 340 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I average of 86.1 percent and adult literacy of 40.2 percent against national average of 55.3 percent."

2913,2913,6.2.13.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges Samtse with its warm climate and rich fertile land has high potential to increase cash crop production and also has opportunities for double cropping.
2914,2914,The flat arable land is suitable for farm mechanization.
2915,2915,"Paddy, maize, wheat, buckwheat, barley and millet are some of the cereal crops grown in Samtse."
2916,2916,"Among the cash crop, cardamom, mandarin, areca nut, ginger and wide variety of fruits and vegetables are grown."
2917,2917,"The Dzongkhag also has rich forest resources particularly bamboo, cane and incense plants, and sustainable extraction of these products will contribute to rural income generation."
2918,2918,The Dzongkhag has potential for development of bamboo treatment and preservation industry and cane furniture production.
2919,2919,Minerals such as limestone and dolomite are also found in Samtse.
2920,2920,"Further, proximity to the Indian markets, the completion of Samtse-Phuentsholing highway and the establishment of Damdhum Industrial Estate will provide huge opportunities for economic growth in Samtse."
2921,2921,"In terms of the challenges, increasing agriculture and livestock productivity is constrained by human wildlife conflict, farm labour shortages, lack of adequate irrigation facilities, and lack of storage and marketing facilities."
2922,2922,High levels of illiteracy resulting in low quality of employment and high poverty rates is a major concern.
2923,2923,"341 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I 6.2.13.3 Strategies In keeping with the Plan objective of Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio- economic Development, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) targeted poverty intervention programme ii) improving education outcomes and iii) industrial development."
2924,2924,Samtse has the fourth highest levels of poverty in the country.
2925,2925,"Therefore, one key strategy will be the implementation of the targeted poverty reduction programme."
2926,2926,"Under the programme, five villages namely Khempa, Gibjee, Kamai Banzang, Majuwa and Cibichang will be supported under REAP Phase II."
2927,2927,"Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self- help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households within the village."
2928,2928,The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the centre.
2929,2929,The Poverty Analysis Report 2012 indicates a direct correlation between poverty levels and education.
2930,2930,People with low literacy rate were poorer and there was a significant reduction in poverty rate if the household head attended secondary levels of education both in urban and rural Bhutan.
2931,2931,The low level of literacy is one of the main factors for high poverty rates in the Dzongkhag.
2932,2932,"Therefore, improving education outcome will be a priority."
2933,2933,"The Dzongkhag will work closely with the Ministry of Education to ensure adequate infrastructure facilities, teachers and teaching materials are made available and where relevant consolidation of schools to improve quality and efficiency of education will be explored."
2934,2934,"The close proximity to the Indian market, availability of mineral reserve base, wide variety of agricultural products, and the completion of Samtse-Phuentsholing highway and the Dhamdum Industrial Estate in the Eleventh Plan offer opportunities for Samtse to develop as medium and large scale industrial hub."
2935,2935,The Dzongkhag in close consultation with the relevant central agencies will work towards creating an enabling environment in the Dzongkhag for establishment of medium and large scale industries.
2936,2936,"The industries could be mineral based, agro-based or wood/cane based."
2937,2937,"The Dzongkhag will also put in place appropriate strategies to tackle human wildlife conflict, address farm labour shortages, and strengthen storage, distribution and marketing facilities, particularly for agricultural products, drinking water shortages etc."

3100,3100,"A Royal Heritage Trail from Bumthang to Trongsa has been opened, further boosting the tourism growth in both the Dzongkhags."
3101,3101,The Dzongkhag however faces acute shortage of hospitality and other tourists facilities and services which are very important especially during the peak tourist seasons.
3102,3102,"Currently, there are only three resorts/guesthouses/hotels which meet the service standards for international tourists."
3103,3103,The Dzongkhag is also confronted with the problem of small and fragmented land holdings.
3104,3104,Many farmers do not own land and depend on sharecropping.
3105,3105,Hence any efforts towards cash crop and commercial farming are confronted with the problems associated with the pattern of land holdings.
3106,3106,"Other challenges faced by the farmers include farm labour shortage, human wildlife conflict, shortage of water, and lack of storage and marketing facilities."
3107,3107,"6.2.17.3 Strategies In keeping with the Plan objective of Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio- economic Development, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity, ii) tourism development, ii) facilitating establishment of cottage, small and medium enterprises, and iii) 363 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I targeted poverty intervention programme."
3108,3108,"Agriculture and Livestock productivity - The challenges of small and fragmented land holdings will be addressed by providing high yielding seeds, establishment of farmer groups/ cooperatives, and training on new and efficient cropping technologies."
3109,3109,"Issues of irrigation facilities, human wildlife conflicts, marketing and storage will be addressed."
3110,3110,Efforts shall also be made to improve livestock productivity through introduction of improved breed of livestock AI programmes and supply of pure jerseys cows.
3111,3111,"Besides, programmes to increase productivity will include improved pasture management and feed and fodder development plans."
3112,3112,"Promoting Tourism - In close collaboration with the Tourism Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses the Dzongkhag will facilitate development of tourism infrastructure such as hotels, community lodges, farm houses, etc, and new products unique to the Dzongkhag based on local handicrafts products, culture, history and eco-tourism trails."
3113,3113,"Facilitating Establishment of Cottage, Small and Medium Enterprises - The commissioning of Mangdechhu Hydroelectric Power project in 2017-18 provides an excellent opportunity for development of cottage, small, and medium enterprises and industries."
3114,3114,The Dzongkhag in collaboration with the central ministries will support and help in identifying potential enterprises and industries.
3115,3115,"In addition to investments in urban development, market sheds, processing plants, cold storages, produce collection centres shall be built in appropriate places at Gewog and Dzongkhag to support the growth of micro, small and farm enterprises."
3116,3116,"Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, five villages namely Phumzur, Pangzur, Thangyel, Bayzam and Wangling will receive support through REAP Phase II."
3117,3117,"Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and additional support at households levels will be provided to the poorest households within the village."

3137,3137,"In the north, it borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China."
3138,3138,"It is situated at an elevation ranging from 1,300 to 7,300 meters above sea level."
3139,3139,"Thimphu Dzongkhag has eight Gewogs namely Chang, Dagala, Geyni, Kawang, Lingzhi, Maedwang, Naro and Soe."
3140,3140,It is also supported by one Drungkhag of Lingzhi and Thimphu Thromde.

3143,3143,The mean annual household income is almost double the national average in 2012 and the health and education indicators report significantly better outcomes compared to the rest of the country.
3144,3144,"However, unemployment rate was twice the national average."
3145,3145,"The high rate of unemployment is attributed to high levels of inmigration to Thimphu, mostly youth."
3146,3146,"368 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I The majority of Thimphu resident are engaged in trade and commerce, construction and service sectors."
3147,3147,"In remote Gewogs such as Soe, Naro, Lingzhi, Geneykha and Dagala, the majority of people are engaged in agriculture and livestock farming."
3148,3148,"The main agricultural products are paddy, wheat, mustard and beans which are grown for commercial purposes."
3149,3149,"Vegetables such as chillies, potatoes, radish and turnip are also grown in all the Gewogs."
3150,3150,"Fruits like plums, walnuts, apricots, apples, pears and peaches are grown for commercial purpose."
3151,3151,Apple is grown on a large scale for export to the neighboring countries of India and Bangladesh.
3152,3152,Chilly is a vegetable grown on a commercial basis.
3153,3153,Livestock rearing is another important occupation for the rural people with most farmers establishing back yard dairy and poultry farms.
3154,3154,"6.2.18.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges Thimphu being the capital city, is well endowed with socio-economic infrastructure facilitates and better economic opportunities."
3155,3155,This has lead to high rate of inward migration with number of people from other Dzongkhags moving to Thimphu in search of jobs and better health and education services.
3156,3156,"The rapid rate of inward migration is not only putting extra pressure on existing infrastructure facilities but also creating new challenges for the Dzongkhag such as the followings: What used to be green agricultural fields just a few years ago has now been converted into commercial, institutional and housing apartments, roads, bridges etc."
3157,3157,This has lead to lower agricultural productivity in the Dzongkhag.
3158,3158,The Dzongkhag reports the lowest levels of forest coverage at 42.86 percent (RNR Statistic 2012).
3159,3159,"Issues of urban waste management, housing and water shortages, pollution, congestion etc are on the rise."
3160,3160,"Rapid urbanization has also led to emerging social issues such as youth engaging in anti-social activities partly due to high levels of youth unemployment, rising crime, growing urban poverty, gradual loss of the close knit community ties, etc."
3161,3161,"The neighbouring areas like Khasadrapchu, Kawang and Depsi are growing rapidly."
3162,3162,"Therefore, there is an urgent need to ensure local area plans for these areas are finalized to avoid unplanned growth of these areas."
3163,3163,"369 Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I The Dzongkhag has opportunities for enhancing agricultural production as paddy, wheat, mustard, beans and vegetables such as chillies, potatoes, radish and turnip are grown in all the Gewogs."
3164,3164,"However, issues of human wildlife conflict, storage and marketing, water etc need to be addressed to optimize opportunities."
3165,3165,"The interior Gewogs of Soe, Naro, Dagala and Lingzhi have potential in enhancing their income from sustainable harvesting of non-wood forest based products such as cordyceps and medicinal plants, besides livestock."
3166,3166,"Similarly, Geney Gewog has potential for sustainable harvesting of masutake and other mushrooms."
3167,3167,"6.2.18.3 Strategies In keeping with the Plan objective of Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio- economic Development, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) agriculture and livestock development and improving health and education outcomes, and ii) targeted poverty intervention programme."
3168,3168,"Development of agriculture and livestock outcomes will be through enhancing production by addressing issues of water shortages, human wildlife conflict, storage and marketing facilities, besides providing proactive extension support services."
3169,3169,Further improvement of health and education services will be undertaken by constructing a new 40 bedded District hospital in Thimphu and educational infrastructure will be rationalized to improve delivery of education services.
3170,3170,"Other major infrastructure investment planned in the Dzongkhag during the Eleventh Plan are the construction of Public Health Laboratory, construction of National Rehabilitation Resource Centre, permanent craft bazaar, renovation of Phajoding Goenpa and restoration of Lingzhi Dzong."
